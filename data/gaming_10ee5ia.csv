parolebot,That's because you're playing it out of order. You need to swap Abe and Mario. Makes a huge difference.
HoldingKnight,"Just wait untill you find a series named ""The"", thats when you will get confused."
nick_corob,"That's because you're not using the Samsung Odyssey monitor.

It will all make sense once you get it, trust me bro."
IforgotwhatIwasdoing,That's because you're missing Lost Odyssey. Really ties the series together.
Synner1985,Awww Oddworld - had such a blast with that game.
ResolveGood,"It's confusing but might become clearer if you get familiar with the source material. Stanley Kubrik's film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" which was based on the epic poem ""The Odyssey"" by Homeros."
antithesis56,Think of it like Final Fantasy games: None of the numbered ones are remotely related story-wise. They're pretty much all different games  with the same title
Feisty-Crow-8204,That’s because you gotta start with The Odyssey by Homer and end with 2001: A Space Odyssey. That will make more sense.
Gymnastboatman,"They even changed the spelling with Oddysee 4, it’s absurd"
Cleverbird,"Abe's Oddysee is the main reason why I could never spell odyssey correctly. Took me many years before I realized it was a pun saying ""Abe's Odd 'y See"""
Infamous-Lab-8136,"Well yeah, if you miss Etrian Odyssey to tie it all together it wouldn't make sense."
nezaros9,What about Twinsen's ODYSSEY?
RoboQwop405,You seem to have lost the Lost Odyssey
Wrex-,"Well, wait till you find out there is a book prequal."
SpaceBiking,You forgot the best episode: Twinsen Odyssey
neoslith,Anyone play One Piece yet? I've been reading the manga but I'm barely into the time skip. Would I still enjoy the game?
Alucard-VS-Artorias,"How long to finish all of Assassin's Creed Odyssey you may wonder...

Well for me Assassin's Creed Odyssey took me a little over 400 hours to finish everything. All achievements, all missions, side missions, challenges, discovered all areas, and everything associated with the DLCs too.

I did like the game and I do like Assassin's Creed in general but damn that took a ton of time. One might say it was a real ODYSSEY 😅"
Pairdice,"You forgot the experimental, brooding but upbeat anime ""trying to find myself"" dungeon crawling years.

Etrian Odyssey."
rembranded,And not to mention the spin-off game 'Enslaved: Odyssey to the West' and the movie adaptation '2001: A Space Odyssey'
Romnonaldao,"What's hard to understand?

Odysseus returns from the Trojan Wars after 20 years at sea

next

The Templars use the tale to thier advantage, taking control of the Mediterranean. The Assassins fight back against them

 next

The battles of the Assassins and Templars inspire a new generation of to take up sailing, and find adventure on the sea, calling themselves Pirates

next

The worlds seas becomes explored, and charted. exploration is abandoned. centuries pass. The remnants of human civilization coalesce into a single floating city called Metro Kingdom

next

Metro City becomes completely consumed by Capitalism and profits. The lower races are enslaved and put to work making snack cakes"
Lvl7King,Oddworld is a severely underrated game.
Leon_The_Greek123,"You spent 10 years trying to get home after winning a devastating war, surviving all kinds of lethal threats and temptations, only to end up back home with hundreds of lovers competing for your wife's hand. You kill them all and regain the trust and loyalty of your wife."
AkeemKaleeb,"Y'all didn't read the Iliad first, that's the problem. It makes much more sense once you get the pretext."
infinitezero8,Jokes aside - I'm actually having a good time with OP: Odyssey.
Smittx,Anyone else remember Twinsen’s Odyssey?
NastySnapper,Elite Dangerous Odyssey 😳
dylsky_,"You idiot.

You forgot the reboot to the franchise, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West."
amitrion,Well because Illiad just seems silly
Rev_LoveRevolver,Try playing them on a Magnavox Odyssey game console and the progression will become very clear.
Hollowsong,"That's like saying ""I never understood the Journey saga""

Because I'm lazy: https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?q=journey"
DaymD,"Such a weird saga, the franchise has been passed around developers for years now too, never settling :)"
goodolarchie,"Abe's Oddworld wasn't perfect but man those games were ahead of their time and didn't get the acclaim it deserved at the time.  You look at all these iterative puzzle + exploration games, Abe catered to an older audience and took off the kid gloves.

If there's a game that deserves a faithful remaster it's Oddworld."
A_Brewtiful_Mind,Still easier to follow than Kingdom Hearts plot!
GabagoolsNGhosts,"Was replaying Abe's Odyssey on my Vita last year and wowzers what an adult themed game for kids lol still super fun, too."
etherealcaitiff,"Odyssey deez nuts, got em"
XsStreamMonsterX,That's because you're missing a couple more games. Need to skip to the Etrian Odyssees in between each of these.
Expensive-Cow4587,You have to watch the movie to understand the timeline. It's called 2001: a space odyssey
GonzoNawak,I just want one good onepiece game ffs .......
JT-Lionheart,"Abe did it first two over two decades ago. Honestly though the “Odyssey” name is just a epic way of saying “adventure”. I think Assassin’s Creed rightfully used it in terms of the theme of the setting of Ancient Greece where the word “odyssey” was invented based on the classic story or what sone would call the first adventure story “The Odyssey”. But now it’s used often as a trendy title.

 I’m surprised no one has used “Trek” given Star Trek made that popular. Could you imagine if Super Mario Galaxy was named “Super Mario Trek”? Honestly that’s sounds like that could be a title for a new Mario game that doesn’t have to be about space."
AyoItzE,"Hello? Missing the best Odyssey of them all, Lost Odyssey."
mlvisby,"I actually want to give One Piece Odyssey a go. Open-world games based on anime doesn't come often, most anime games are either linear or fighting/musou. 

I do enjoy One Piece as an anime, even if the arcs become obnoxiously long. Cake Island feels like a slog which is why I am still on it. Sick of hearing Big Mom say Wedding Cake-u a billion times."
sonofamatt,The writing is a mess in this series. character plot lines literally just drop off in between games.
tranceformerfx777,"Odyssey has become a word that more or less encapsulates a journey or quest that's centered around a singular person - much like Homers ""The Odyssey"" that's about Odysseus, the King of Ithaca, and his journey to return home after the 10 year war with Troy.

Oh wait this is a shit-post nevermind lol."
EVASIVEroot,"Well, it's worth a read."
Draftables,I personally loved the original by Homer.
medi3val11111,You forgot Lost Odyssey. AMAZING RPG.
Donke267,"Oh boy, do I have a book for you"
WallishXP,Wait till you read the books.
YJS2K,Forgot Enslaved: Odyssey to the West
ghostmark2005,"When i was a kid I couldn't play Abe's odessey it was too hard for me, so instead I used to turn the TV up so load and make Abe fart over and over again it drove my parents mad"
InwardXenon,"That's because you've not played the secret one, Lost Odyssey."
Necrogaz,"Pfft is easy, the guy from AC gets in a fight with Poseidon who then casts a curse on him where he would get more and more deformed as time goes on, then on OP: Odyssey he decides to go searching for poseidon to take revenge on him, thats why theres a big water vortex on the art, then you get more deformed and time has gone so far into the future that now you live in the real world but still more cartoonish and deformed, thats why you look so weird compared to regular people in that game, you also decide to take the profession of plumber, in the hope of finding a clue from poseidon whereabouts inside the sewage water system but after looking around for so long you finally end up looking like a humanoid tadpole in a fucked up world thanks to your curse where eventually you will become yet another tadpole in the slave army of Poseidon"
MonkeyBred,"I thought the series was centered around aqueducts through the ages, starting with Appius Claudius inventing them in Rome, the Mario maintaining the surplanting kingdom, the post modern world water works,and finally, distant future alien civilizations adapting to our plumbing. No?"
xYevon,"You're missing the original: Lost Odyssey
Fucking great but long game."
The_Blue_Rooster,You need to read the [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey) to really get it.
StrawberryPeachies,Abe!!! Omg I missed those games so much! I need to see where I can get a copy of them again!
Erebor-,And horrible book adaptions all of them!
robonick360,Don’t forget the original pencil paper game from 2700 years ago
etrulzz,"I see Oddworld I upvote 

I'm a simple man"
KingBurakkuurufu,Do you not know what Odyssey means?
Fancy-Agent-33,r/shittygamedetails
,[deleted]
darexinfinity,I've never heard of the bottom games until now.
thejokerofunfic,Be patient. The ninth game is where it all really starts to tie together. I've read the manga so I know.
NoobSmokes,I believe they are using the word based off its definition..a long and eventful or adventurous journey or experience.
rookie-1337,"The order is aco, opo, Abe’s, Mario o"
ImpressiveCourt6022,If Abe was wearing a headpiece I would say that it’s about a magical hat that takes people on amazing adventures.
SonicFire93,"You see, One Piece is the first one, you go then with Assassins' Creed, then Oddworld and Mario are part 1 and 2 of the last arc, get it?"
G0sTly11,Odd yea see
sexyunicorn13,"so there is this guy named od, so need me some of that odyssey😩"
AdonisGaming93,It'll make sense once you get Munch's Oddysee
Palmzbyaboi,So it’s taken from homers Odyssey and just means a epic journey/adventure
Magmomies,Ahhh... The Malaka Mamma Mia quartet of odyssey
PeterTinkle,This hurts.
WhiteFox1992,Next you can try the Revelations saga.
Jackslashjill,"Only Assassin’s Creed involves any reference to Odysseus, the rest are just sparkling journeys"
Faelysis,*Modern adaptation* from the same old book
Bluemars776,Because you didn't included the most important chapter: Omero's Odyssey
Sandor_06,You didn’t read Odysseus by Homer. You need the back story to fully appreciate the games.
The_Chaos_Pope,"Part of your issue is that Abe's isn't part of the Odyssey saga. Abe's is an Oddysee, not an Odyssey. 

I have no idea how the rest fit together though. GLHF with that."
Lucas-DM,"I personally never understood the Zero saga. What with Star Fox Zero, Perfect Dark Zero, Resident Evil Zero, Megaman Zero and Katana Zero i just lost track of things."
Exevioth,One Super Assassin’s Oddworld Odyssey 2: Electric Boogaloo.
TheBostonKremeDonut,"God, I love Oddworld. Easily in my top 10 favorite series of all time. Super excited for the next game to be revealed, hopefully this year or next!"
Kangarou,"It goes Assassin’s -> One Piece -> Mario and Abe happen at the same time.

The Greek empire fell, so people turned to piracy, but once society was reestablished, those captured were forced to work in the mines while the upper class got to galavant around a bright colorful world. So simple."
grimenishi,"You forgot Lost Odyssey, one of the best of them all."
nejfrfn,Is One Piece Odyssey any good?
SenpaiSwanky,What do we think of One Piece Odyssey? Where does the story start and end relative to the show and manga?
yeusus,Spans multiple worlds/backdrops/themes...odyssey
SwiftIy2,"Oooooh the days of ""Oddworld: Strangers Wrath"". Jesus boi, thanks for the nostalgia!!!"
NonCorporealEntity,"Missed one, but I can see why.. it is the ""Lost"" Odyssey"
OtterishDreams,Also the real Odyssey
Spram2,"True story: I only learned how to spell Odyssy because of Mario Odyssy.

Edit: No I didn't. :("
Denamic,"Less confusing than the Kingdom Hearts timeline, at least"
pygmeedancer,"Well I played through the whole Darke Franchise. Dark Souls, Dark Sector, Dark Cloud. Even the spin-off Perfect Dark. And I couldn’t make hide nor hair of the story."
multiversalnobody,Oddworld is unexpected but certainly welcome. The intro to that gane scared the shit out of me as a kid
thunderchild120,"I know at least the two games on the right have a common thread of ""possessing"" enemies as a core gameplay mechanic, so there's that."
Nexusaurus,"Well of course it doesnt make sense, Abe doesnt belong in there, they spell ""Oddsyee"" different. Completely different storyline. Much darker."
everything_is_bad,And it’s nothing like the source material by Homer
tigojones,"Of course not, they haven't released it all, yet."
NoSitRecords,Abe was recruited in prison into a secret society that fights the rubber pirates on the open sea. Abe must find the Holy Hat entity that will guide him to the secret rubber fruit tree where the pirates get their special powers from and destroy it.
skewp,You're playing them out of order.
Jordiscu7,"I played AC: Origins and absolutely loved it, was recommended multiple times to try Odyssey because it ""was so much better"", so I bought the premium because why not, and I did not enjoy a single second of the 5 hours of play time I did before uninstalling and never playing again."
Xx_Ph03n1X_xX,"You're missing Lost Odyssey, it's a pretty important piece that ties it all together."
Moukatelmo,Pro tip : it was not released in chronological order
Northman_Ast,With Abe its oddySEE not OddySEY
Suriaky,"I like the part where he said ""It's Odyssing time"" and he started odyssing everyone"
FlowingMochi,One Piece is sick. Haven’t played the game. Point still stands.
Hooligans_,Out of order and missing Munch's Odyssey?
GalacticShoestring,"Oddworld was a fun, weird game back in the day!"
Kilo1125,"You played them out of order. Its Oddworld, Mario, Assassin's Creed, then One Piece"
playC3,Still a better series than Twilight.
bentnai1,It makes more sense with Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Really ties it all together
BrainCrusher22,Assassin's creed odyssey is a masterpiece
wolf224,Multiverse
Alternative_Gold_993,It's an easy to use word that describes a vast adventure without any effort on the creators part.
Kemerd,"You have to start with the original written one, then it all makes sense."
,This reminded me of that story where Oddworld saved that old man from suicide.

QueenCobra91,oddworld was the first. its old as fuck
zappy487,"Ass. Creed Odyssey is about the Void Century.

Mario Odyssey is around the birth of the devil fruits and the Ancient Technology, with Mario Mario having the Hito Hito No Mi Model Cappy. His nemesis Bowser is Kaido's predecessor.

Oddworld is about the Mink Tribe pre-Zou.

And of course OP Odyssey is between WCI and Wano."

Best_Pidgey_NA,"You're playing them in the wrong order. It's Oddworld Odyssey, Super Mario Odyssey, Assassin's Creed and then One Piece:Odyssey. It'll make a lot more sense then."
Fuckingfolly,"What's to understand? Greeks, Plumbers, Pirates, and Abe. That's just how it is."
Andro451,"It works like this:

The saga is based upon our real world. The timeline differs at the first game, where the events take place. Eventually, a man named kratos kills off the gods of that universe, which we know happens due to a spin-off franchise.

Due to the death of all gods, the universe collapses in on itself, before being reborn. Now, in modern times, feudal societies still exist, and possession of anyone without a hat is possible. 

thousands of years later, sea levels have risen, and piracy is popular. The human race eventually develops consistent space travel.

Earth is taken over by the sun in a solar flare, but ultimately, the human race survives and evolved to be unrecognizable to their first incarnation. Every world they land on is given the same name: oddworld."
HooliganScrote,"Well the problem is you’re not looking for historical accuracy here so the games are all out of wack. The games actually start with Oddworld, and then into Mario. The world takes a weird dive when you hit one piece but just hold on. There’s a lot of out-of-game lore, then some more baddies appear and you should be hitting roughly the Spartan thing that happened, which is assassins creed."
