myslead,"disregarding the whole situation, the guy who's just looking over his shoulder is kinda hilarious lol"
ToxicTroubble,Was the yellow guy not his accomplice
mindenfoglaltvolt,He sounds like a darks souls npc
sucr4m,the voip started funny and took a bad turn really quick. and then the whole situation got funny again. based scav.
KL1418,He was saying lines like an npc lol
DangerouslyBased22,Honestly scavs robbing each other at gunpoint in a dirty stairwell is peak Tarkov
Fernanddeezz,did this man really trap u for 5 minutes for a broken shotgun and something else XD
-Here-There-,"Man, that guy may need a therapist.

Also looked like the scav that killed him tea bagged after so all is well"
CrazyStuntsMan,Bro was just mad his karma was in the negatives
King_of_the_Dot,It's not so much toxic as it is cringe.
gtggtfg,"""are you going to shoot up a school?"" he said while displaying school shooter behaviour"
NotRobPrince,"Oof that’s embarrassing. That guy sounds so fucking cringe as well, think he’s projecting a bit with the bullied in school, sounds like a proper 🤓"
Zer0Cyber_YT,This is actually sad. He thinks he's so bad ass and so intimidating to have done this to you. If only you spawned with a pistol so you could double head eyes the two cunts even at that close range
Honelith,Respect the karma. It's a force not to be tampered with.
rextheinfluence,I guess you could say he got his Scav … Karma 😎
ForgeKid,Hold alt+w and start blastin
Crazy-Turn225,I would kill them both. Just because he think I care about karma. Its easy to repair reputation with fence anyway. Doesn't matter at the end.
Sarc0h-,Self awareness is an important stat to level
mach_z3ro_x,That’s our version of Xbox chat
Thermock,"""Your rep is more important than your pride, and that is very sad"" - ☝️🤓

Seriously, what a fucking dweeb. He was really willing to sit there until you dropped, what, a 40 durability shotgun and your vest?"
bouccibangguccigang,Hahahah what a twat
smackahoe_chief,Wait.. there is a crate there
ElegantAnything11,Average Tate fan in Tarkov right there lol
Sufficient-Leading11,"i would have just left the game but good on ya for getting your sweet revenge.

PS i would have killed yellow shirt while extracting"
DarthSkath,Hahah glad toxic people get screwed
iAmRadic,I hope the guy comes across this clip and realizes what a piece of shit he is
bondbuyingbandosboi,and hes Br\*tish
1mperia1,"I had one guy dead ass say ""i need to extract with a broken limb can you just shoot me in the leg"".

I shot him in the leg 2s before my extract, i knew his angle."
voxyvoxy,The plight of EU servers.
,thats a guy who spends most of his time infront of a screen
elgordon1,Just saw this on tik tok. Good stuff
obr_kevin,"Maybe I'm fucked, but I thought that was mad hilarious. His voice and the delivery was amazing, sounds like a villain in a movie lmao."
Sr_DingDong,Bro is on EU servers and he's talking about shooting up schools and shit....
Runb4its2late,"""Drop every fing"""
franbiren,"3 years ago I've met the most toxic streamer I've seen in my life

Dude wiped our team in labs fair and square(he was extremely tryharding tho), not mad about that. I searched his nick and found his stream

He was with a buddy and was a north American playing in the Brazilian server(obviously abusing high ping when it was a thing), I asked him about that and he goes ""yo one of the Mexicans we killed hopped into my stream"" ""it's franbiren, where's his body?"" he dropped the loot of my better geared friend and grabbed the entirety of my kit ""you see this? This shit is mine now bitch""

After he extracted he said ""nah I'm not even gonna sell any of this, you touched it all over"" and deleted everything

Straight up one of the most disrespectful things I've ever seen on a stream, good thing he got banned like a month later"
mrohhhtrue,What a fucking loser
squidshark,Bro a similar thing happened to me on factory earlier today. Guy was blocking me in the 1st floor office room for a long time
DarthSkath,He said I’m not trapped but you are idk but looks like you got trapped in a dead body lol
Tar-cop,"This is the kinda shit I would do for the meme, give up because I couldnt keep a straight face and then run off to nade myself. Dudes a weirdo."
Absolute_-Unit,"thanks, this is what I needed to see today"
Deimos_PRK,You should have try to aligned them in your screen and shoot and try to get them both at once
19nix90,I like how his lackey is just your lackey now at the end of the raid 😂
darthmatt999,This situation is honestly hilarious
xsubo,So much effort invested to act like a complete loser only to be rocked by an AI lol.
MisterWafflles,Someone was projecting
wizztube33,I think that this is actually hilarious
settingzz,lol that was funny af
twiggsmcgee666,"omfg, I shit myself laughing."
rowdymatt64,"This sounds like [a DNSL bit](https://youtu.be/Vwa3wb0bakg). You should've calmly replied with ""settle down ok?"""
rekonsileme,seems pretty scripted
anxrchyx,Looool I just saw this on tiktok
GoldenPC,"Bro really tried to be intimidating💀💀💀
Im sorry but i cannot take anyone with an austrian or british accent seriously. Like THE most UNintimkdsting voice too on that guy 😐"
2dizzy,Wow. I thought this was a parody. Sounded like an episode of some English comedy show like UK Office lol
Ballz42069,This is probably the best tarkov video I've ever seen
Tman-666,"Lol I met this guy as well on customs same lines, pmc capped us both what a muppet"
gkonn,"Holy shit this was hilarious. With the sidekick in the back not saying anything and them both wearing sunglasses LOL. The ending was comic gold too, the way he turned to see what the shouting was about"
FoxLP11,Pretty sure it was for fun lol
X5RaPiDZZ,Guy definitely deserved that. People like that give gamers bad names
TheCaveGamer,So funny how you extracted with his henchmen
OilLonely3929,Wondering why his buddy scav dropped his gear
jwadams21,AI scav came in clutch lol
YBHunted,To think there are probably 4-6 other people like this that hang out with this guy in their discord and think he's hilarious.. wheeeeewwww
potato_man72643,"average Andrew taint listener this isnt even funny like the blocking part was kinda funny but then he started like stroking his ego off and giving off that ""im such a fucking god your a beta cuck who wont do anything while i fuck your wife. look at me while i project my misfortune and frustration out on some random on a video game"" kinda vibe"
Dustin_Live,Everyone has a plan till they get shot in the mouth.
Sterling_Gator,Online gaming and the internet in general are probably the only places that kid has any power. I’ve seen comments about projecting and that’s sadly most likely the truth.
Stevanous,This was pretty hilarious. I would've tried killing both. RP'ing is kinda rare in this game and is always worth a death imo.
Wickedgamer75,"Was scavin on streets earlier, ran into a fellow Pscav.
I said hello, and he tells me to shut up n****r.

One of my first uses of VOIP and i was kinda stunned, but i guess im the fool for expecting any better."
DustEyezz,"Why wouldn't u just call this cringe person a cretin, a bunch of slurs, ask how much they weigh, why they have no friends and then shoot them both? Lmao."
Vindicator_Golovkin,Toxic? sounded like rp. Normal banter
BF_Goose,"No disrespect friend, but was it worth standing and having to deal with bullshit for like 5 minutes? Also why scav on factory, I've always been curious for peoples reasons for it."
AxTROUSRxMISSLE,God I hate Tarkov so much
Uncle_Bobby_B_,People like that make the game more interesting lol
Tw2k17,British ppl tbh
Enigmaticwords,Lmao potential new meme template right here
CymonRedditsAccount,Im having DanielFromSL vibes here
souleat65,The second that guy turned around to see the scav i'd have killed the yellow guy honestly
WhyAmIEvenHereJesus,And the second guy extracted with you lmao
VALORBANTS,Most sane british person.
kafkamon,Genuinely so cringe
Synatec,"I hope he sees this and clicks it away because he starts cringing.

This is extremely cringe he sounds like that weird kid in the back of class. The one that thinks he has friends but they are just school friends"
AverageMetalConsumer,Looks like the trash got what he deserved.
GavonyTownship,Fucking hurts to listen to. So cringe.
StealthCatUK,"Those people casting wide assumptions on an entire country based on 1 interaction in a video game. Come on lads, use ya fuckin noggins."
Shooter503,"You guys saying this is cringe and shit must not see the comedy behind this. To me the dude doing all the talking is clearly just fucking around trolling, nothing cringe or evil about it, he's literally just flicking OP shit. I don't understand why people can't just have fun with the game and not cry about every encounter they have with other players. If homeboy wants to run around and RP as a scav then so be it, shits pretty funny."
Johannes_Kastaja,You are in for a rough ride online if this is the most toxic player you've met :-/
JustAJauneArc1,I can't be the only dude that found this funny af
FireCrotchEnjoyer,This shits gold
fjordefiesta,"I don't get how this is considered toxic, it's a game about surviving in a sectioned off warzone with dudes trying to survive, wouldn't it be expected that some nasty dudes would be about holding people up at gunpoint for their stuff? 

Interactions like this make the game more interesting, or at least more interesting than if that guy just shot you on sight."
geekrichieuk,This feels staged :/
MisinformedOwl,Ok but lowkey the dude was fucking funny
ChrisWebbys,This isn't even that bad. Toxic? This man's just trying to have some fun. I would love to mess around with this guy if I met him in raid. Interesting VOIP encounters are very fun. You must've got real scared and salty when he trapped you in the corner in the last minute if your raid.
loongod5,This is some DanielFromSL type of content.
Gzalzi,"This is toxic? He didn't call you a single slur, he just trapped you somewhere and held you hostage. That's something that should happen more in this game."
davedaveee,This might be the funniest thing I've seen in a while for tarky. Wow lmao. The other silent accomplice aiming from behind this clown added to the ridiculousness.
rrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeee,guy sounds like a lot of the nerds in the scav karma threads here lmfao
SpeeterTeeter,He sounds exactly like I expected him to also Projecting much?
SneedDeez,He is (excuse me for saying this word) Br\*tish so of course he's toxic. I'm one myself and the majority of us are unhinged hyper-mentally-ill spazzmoids. I've never seen a more undeserving egotistical group of people than my fellow Brits. I wish death upon myself every day.
Jindalunz,"It's funny how you guys take this guy so seriously, it's a fukin game and I'd rather take this than some random child running around screaming the n-word."
GSundo,🤓 you get bullied at school 🤓
ProfessionalCuboid,You just fucking walk away 😂😂
Necessary_Fig_2265,"I’m disappointed you didn’t blast him in the face when he turned you had them both, fuck karma like Santa does"
fiftyfiive,What the fuck did I just watch
thund3rstruck,He got caught monologuing. Love it.
Ok_Cartographer6542,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
natbythefoot,poetic justice in the end
PASTAoPLOMO,I was not expecting that lmfao
RangerSkyy,Bitchmade.
AttackerCat,The best part is his buddy who is just silently extracting with OP after the guy got blasted.
Songniac,If you have negative scav karma are you automatically a traitor scav?
lllSquishylll,Was he talking third person about himself? Kinda wierd...
Always-Panic,The AI Scav even  tea bagged after killing him.
Gaming4Lyfe94,People like that have no self awareness and don’t realize how they just project their own insecurities out loud and sound stupid
Thirdai_,🤣🤣
imtoohai,Karma is an artist
a_goonie,Bro I caught the first half this morning and just caught the rest right now. I would have shot his friend right in the face at extract. I'm upset you didn't.
Plormby102,L
ExtraTwo8934,Nice
wizztube33,u/savevideo
Reggie2b2t,"""You wouldn't defend your property? You would shoot up a school."""
oriaven,"I'm a very good scav, but once in a while it's worth the -0.1 rep to blast toxic nerds."
YouNeedToMoveForward,Yeah EU players are known to be shit
MilkyWhiteNut,"I woulda tried to kill them both, losing out on that tiny bit of scav karma would have been so worth it lol."
Zebra03,Good on ya scav ai for getting the fucker
Sargentcoaltrain74,Mad props to that AI scav for murking his ass and rescuing you. AI’s have a bad rep this wipe for being over powered but in this case it worked in your favor
Illtakeboffum,That scav deserved a treat
WorldlyDivide8986,I love how he's in character.
FireRocs,This is the reason im done with players of tarkov. I wish there was a legitimate singleplayer of this game. Game’s fun and great but the toxic people in this game ruin everything as well as cheaters
murrkpls,Actually making it out with 1 second left is too fucking funny too. Should've shot his friend in the mug right before you made it out.
buttcrimes69,I mean rude but eh not all that toxic.
ImprovementFun6658,"The only thing I thought was when he got shot was, his ego was more important to him then his loot lol"
Anoreth,This is real?
Roman576,"Damn scav bot giving out a phrase that fits well after killing that dude. ""And what are you going to do now huh ?"""
w00fx3,"Shoot your gun away from them so you don't hit them. They're on edge waiting for you to shoot - as soon as you shoot they'll probably unload on you but because you haven't shot them, they'll take the karma hit if they kill you. If by some miracle they hit you but you survive, then you can kill them and gain karma for killing a traitor scav. 

But Cheeki Breeki walking in and laying down some old school justice was golden!"
SKYTHI4N-YT,I’m confused on why you didn’t just shoot them I have t got this game but have thought about getting it but will someone explain
Fussel_Ger,Scripted
nicomiki,the silence….
PainEverlasting,he sounds more like a cunt than anyone I've ever met id have domed him for the audacity
foreignrobin,"The Ai scav that killed him said ""Now what? Now what are you going to do huh?"", poetic justice."
VelvetThunder2319,Shoulda plugged his mate with buckshot to teach him how it goes out here
YoxhiZizzy,"Thank god for the ai scav coming in hot, on a sweet revenge on a silver platter."
Gigachad____,he's right you wasted 6 minutes of your life sitting in a corner for your in game good boy points lmao🤣
JKCinema,But why? I’m confused. Did that Scav hear what was going on and passed judgment on that dude? Lol
Arm4Dill0,"Funny clip, but I don't see that guy as a toxic player, it just looks likes he was roleplaying. That's cool I think, It helps with immersion"
FUCKINHATEGOATS,Everyone here talking about how toxic and cringe he is. Honestly I think this is satire and if that’s the case well done on their part lol this is good content. Reminds me of general Sam intros
Seph491,In that situation I'd just tab out and watch a Youtube video. More amusing to me not only to call his bluff but waste his time. I don't want a scav karma loss or to give him what he wants. Heck if I actually feeling like engaging the guy I'll tell him that I'm just gonna tab out and do something else while the raid timer ticks down. I've got all the time in the world to wait.
iiHadouken,Looks like his buddy starts to loot him after he gets clapped
Silentenemy,Almost instant karma.
X5S,"This lacks your audio, what did you say to him to make him react like this 😅"
sanctionTheOrcs,"scav karma ruined scav raids, change my mind x)"
OkEntertainment8797,Lol nice fake story. Loser
Just_Session_3847,Wow if you think this is toxic I hope you don't go outside too much. You might get your feelings hurt.
MagicToaster05,He was funny ngl
Icy-Voice-2323,"Wouldn't say he's necessarily toxic, just putting on a funny bit for him and his friend and probably also for you, similar to dayz taking a hostage, definitely a funny interaction though."
LOWIQXD,"ur clearly snowflake for even posting it lol, who cares"
Vubor,That dude is funny at like 2 minutes he trys to get stuff from you... Good that you could escape. I would also have waited it out! :D
SupportAndy123,"This is fucking hilarious not even toxic. Stop being a fucking pussy crying about scav loot. Only bitches need to earn money or gear on scav runs. Simply shoot the cunt in the face and extract problem solved not make a reddit post over it, cause literally no one cares"
SobigX,Was getting caught part of your plan?
Magnus5018,"Guys, i have minus 0.67 karma on fence? I barely play scav, never killed a scav or pmc player? I dont understand"
sox3502us,What a sociopath lol
Barchizer,And now you work minimum wage. 😂
NoInformation1632,This is my main issue with scav Karma and the whole Traitor scav thing. There needs to be something like when you Mouse over a scav that's a traitor if my scav could automatically voice line or if you could say something or if there could be some indication that this is a player scav that's killed another scav and you're clear to go kill him. It wouldn't take very much work to implement but yet BSG wants to put stuff on your lap like this that serves no purpose but only harms people who want to play by the rules
Remington238,"Stupid trash talk and fucking around in a video game = toxic

Ok"
Educational-Web-5787,Who was that random hero
Obsidian_mkULTRA,That was amazing
k7512,LMFAO get DOMED kid
SenpaiBoogie,Lmaoooooo I love it . Fuck that cunt
Spook-lad,That scav is a fucking sigma god
Rich-Ad-3543,i cant post image of lightkeeper's varicose. lightkeeper has varicose coming from his neck to his right cheek.
Kerstekind,">You didn't stand up for yourself when you got bullied in school and now you work minimum wage

That was so ODDLY specific that it must've been projecting. Glad he's Bri'ish tho, and not American. The school shooting comment is probably a foreshadowing of what would've happened if he was..."
Adrenalcookie,This isint  really toxic this is just funny
