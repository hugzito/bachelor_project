You can say more funding for mental health but when compared with other countries there is not much difference on that front.

Plus there's the strong potential for abuse by people who should not be working with kids, but ""kids need to know this so they can be safe"" causes rational adults not to see the power imbalance or potential for harm.

If you want to sell specifically to the left wing and terminally online, use a brand no one cares about so that the potential success is bigger than the immediate loss.

Post-indictment poll: Trump surges to largest-ever lead over DeSantis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/1299yga/postindictment_poll_trump_surges_to_largestever/,Zadiuz,"These polls are showing what Republicans thing about Trump. Not everyone else. Trump is still universally disliked by moderates. Moderates are who decide who wins elections. I don't get why that concept is so hard for some people to grasp.

Trump has no chance at winning another general election. he had an ""ok"" standing with moderates the last election, and still lost. Now his standings with moderates following jan6 and his actions the last year have had him plummet in their support.

Democrats want nothing more than Trump to win, because they know then that they get the win. This below is what we are going to see next election.

1. Trump is the republican nominee, the national vote again returns to the concept of voting against Trump, not voting for any one specific candidate. Allows for a weak democrat like Biden to be elected.
2. Trump does not win the GOP nominee, decides he runs as an independent, absolutely destroys everyone's chance at getting voted in with the exception of whichever democrat puppet runs this time.
3. DeSantis runs as the nominee, Trump stops his campaign. DeSantis then has the highest chance of actually winning because now we return to voting for your favorite nominee, instead of voting against Trump.  (Also if you look at the national polls out there, many have Biden destroying Trump, but DeSantis beating Biden)",PinkClouds20

Former Planned Parenthood Director Commits Suicide While Being Investigated In Child Porn Case | The Daily Wire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12o9kqo/former_planned_parenthood_director_commits/,pointsouturhypocrisy,">In December 2018, Yergeau posted, “Excited to announce that today I start a new job on the **marketing/communications team** at Planned Parenthood of Southern New England. Excited to be working on **issues I’m passionate about**: healthcare access, reproductive and **sexual health, diversity and inclusion**, civic engagement, and voting rights.”

Let's be clear about what his job was. He was in charge of pushing hormone therapy onto kids. Those are the same group of kids being targeted by predators in recent years.

PP has expanded their business in recent years to be in the ""gender affirming care"" industry. I can't for the life of me figure out how that has anything to do with ""reproductive health."" Unless, of course, you look at it through the lens of eugenics. Then it suddenly makes sense. PP was created as a genocidal weapon against the black community. Now its expanded as a *totally inclusive* genocidal weapon. If they can't get you in the womb, they can sure sterilize you when you're old enough to reproduce.

For a company that claims only 3% of their business is abortions, id be curious what their projections are for adding this new line of revenue. That would give us a much clearer picture of their intentions toward sterilizing children.

I really wish the House GOP would investigate and make public all of PP's hidden financials. Id also love to know how many of our elected officials have invested in PP. Id be willing to bet that of the pro-abortion sect of our government, the percentage is likely in the high 90's. Then, I'd also like to know how many of those elected officials have invested in the Chinese baby parts industry (ya know, the places PP sells their baby parts to). Id bet the people invested in both is 100%",yuri_2022

But it should be the act, not the who did it, I feel like we should be focused on. It’s a hard topic, I understand that. In my opinion, I don’t think any kind of gun law, is going to solve this. I am pro gun, but not assault weapons. I feel like if it’s for protection, in your home, do you need that kind of gun? Probably not. That’s just my opinion on it. But, to each their own. As long as you are not hurting anyone, you do you. Now. I do think, maybe something towards mental health, but not even mental health really. More like family support services. I know it’s not a popular opinion, but until people start treating children better, then some have, I feel like we will get more of the same.

In reality, a mitochondrial Eve is not the first female of a species, but merely the most recent female historically from which all living animals of a species can trace their ancestry.

Perhaps some of her contemporaries had no surviving children. Or they only had sons, which wouldn’t have passed on their mitochondrial DNA.

Probably not.  If you can’t trust a child to do that, but you believe they know what’s best for themselves and adjusting major things about their bodies??

I don’t know about other parents, but the only thing that kept me from losing my shit with my kids at that age was the knowledge that they were going through a phase and would outgrow it.  My son went through the nuggets phase, mac & cheese phase, an addiction to grilled salmon for 6 months, etc.  Never once did I think I would just stock a freezer full of this crap because I’d decided that’s all he would eat until old age.

Maybe these aren’t parallel ideas, who knows.  What is next, we’re going to start eliminating statutory rape as a crime, because suddenly 10 year olds can decide they are old enough to be in an adult relationship?

Who gives a shit that a book dealing with trans stuff is available in a library? If you are that concerned with it, then how about actually doing some parenting instead of blaming someone else.

Trump never refused to do anything. The authorities directly under his authority   as leader of the executive branch. Decided that instead of doing their jobs Decided to use that authority against Trump on behalf of a corrupt majority in congress 🙄

The sooner that Republicans wake up to the fact that those said authorities are corrupt to the core and one sided. And that any republican president will have that authority used against them and those that put them into office. And any demacrat president will have 100% control over said authorities to go after any republican and their voters without restraint the sooner we can come together.  

Think about it under Trump exactly who was it going after Trump. Under bidin exactly who is it going after republican voters.",intelligentreviews

If you look at the Manhattan DA's official website, their conviction rates and other relevant data area available. 

That DA outright dismisses over 50 percent of the felony charges in the jurisdiction.  52 percent of felonies that they don't outright dismisses are plead down to misdemeanors.

The Manhattan DA has a conviction rate of 51%, which includes plea deals.  The plea deals are just freebie statistics that benefit this percentage, but don't decrease it.  Lord only knows what their conviction rate is when they don't get a plea deal.

The misdemeanor statistics are just as awful.  They succesfully convict on an absymal 28 percent of misdemeanor charges.

All of this despite the fact that the Manhattan DA - thanks to fines they imposed on Wall Street - is the best funded DA in America.

Crime is up 38 percent, too, since Bragg took office.

This was enacted before the infrastructure was set in place to easily transition to meet the requirements: manufacturers such as Trane, Carrier, etc. are scrambling to provide products that adhere to them. The supply chain is fucked, the systems in some cases are too large for residential applications (higher efficiency is achieved through larger coil sizes that don’t fit in attics or crawl spaces) and they’ve made it illegal to sell brand new equipment that doesn’t meet the guidelines. So last year’s brand new equipment that didn’t sell by December 31, 2022 essentially will just sit in warehouses. They’re also phasing out the refrigerant used in most systems. All this with absolutely no regard to the ability of the industry to handle all of this.

influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.

There have always been people like this. Born this way. Hermaphrodites are real people. As a teacher, I had a few trans students, and they were regular kids in every other way. They didn't disrupt the class or behave more sexually than anyone else.  They're just kids. Born with an obstacle. More of society is getting educated and coming around to support them now, and they are forming communities and getting brave.

For centuries - millenia now - society has beaten and killed these people if they got brave. So we still have these cruel bigots, too. But now they know that they could get in trouble for forcing these people back into the closet with ridicule and violence. So, it manifests in religious intolerance. They decide it's good to discriminate against these people and make them second class citizens, because they believe it's evil. This is being done by CHRISTIANS?

When did Christ call out anyone? It wasn't gays or trans or anything like that. What Jesus talked about, over and over, is loving everyone: sinners, our enemies, immigrants, lepers, criminals ... everyone. Jesus did call out the pharisees and religious hypocrites repeatedly. For many things, but mostly for their superior attitude and their intolerance.

The American Medical Association,  American Psychiatric Association, and the American Psychological Association all support these people. They don't try to tell another person who they are. How can I know someone better than they know themselves? What business is it of mine what they want to be called or who they sleep with? Does Jesus want you to let those things stop you from loving them? When did he say that?",JudgeJeanineFans

These fucking bastards wouldn't know a damn thing about true hatred if it smacked them across the lips with a leather glove! I don't see people defending the actions of other school shooters because of their identity, and ya wanna know why? Because it is a disgustingly ridiculous idea that insinuates that the lives lost to violence were somehow justified because an insecure loser decided that they were going to let hatred rule their lives.

I'm not going to act like I know anything about whatever hardships trans people are going through, I'm not one of them and can't say I'll ever truly understand that life. However, I do know a thing or two about humanity, and that is that no level of suffering or injustice you may have been dealt will ever justify reprehensible acts that would still be condemned if they were committed by someone who never experienced such injustices. An evil act can be committed by anyone, and thus there can only be so much empathy given before we begin to realize just who the most unforgivable people are; however, we unfortunately learned of one of those people after they committed a truly horrific act that will have scarred many innocent lives, and broken the families of the six victims who we can only pray for now as they try to carry on with their new lives.

I'll admit to having very mixed opinions on the matter of transgenderism and the culture around it, but it's shit like this that honestly infuriates me because of just how harmful it is. Groups like that do nothing but divide our society by pushing for hate-fueled tribalism and radicalism in a stupidly vain attempt to force the rest of us to blindly accept and never question their world views, but all they really do is create unnecessary resent and animosity to their causes because of just how horrible they are at actually making a good point. Whether it's blm, peta, antifa, modern climate activist groups, or whatever radical group you want to throw in, these groups take nuanced and complicated issues and turn them into utter jokes that nobody wants to ever discuss because they know just what kind of bullshit they're in for. Groups like TRAN just make the trans community look like a bunch of tone-deaf assholes with no sense of humanity outside of their own interest groups. That's because they're the ones who'll get the spotlight in this cancerous black smudge of a culture that worships outrage and controversy for the bottom line, all the while there's actual groups and individuals who simply want to open a healthy discussion on these issues in order to help unite people through genuine love and respect. 

But hey, it's way easier to be hateful and selfish, it's way easier than trying to actually have some damn empathy and humility.",intelligentreviews

It's all vehicles that had been given to the Afghan Army many years ago. The Taliban started picking off and seizing those vehicles right after we signed our surrender to the Taliban back in February of 2020. Once that deal was signed, the only options were to go back on the deal and surge tens of thousands of US troops back into Afghanistan indefinitely to keep the Taliban at bay, or continue with the planned pullout knowing there's a good chance the Taliban would eventually take over all Afghan government assets, including their military equipment. 

Right from the start, when the article talks about how many vehicles came from the ""205th Army Corps"", that must be the Afghan Army's 205th which was formed and started being issued western equipment way back in 2004. 

Coincidentally, the US Army's 205th was disbanded around then for overseeing torture in  Abu Ghraib. In retrospect, it's kind of nuts that Bush survived politically and was reelected after getting us into these disastrous wars based on bad intel and then the Abu Ghraib and Torture Memos stuff all came out in 2004. I guess having super loyal media outlets really helped. Fox had already been the biggest cable news channel for a couple years then, pretty much all political radio content was anti-Democrat, and newspapers were still coming off that post-9/11 hesitancy to call out US government mistakes.",intelligentreviews

I never saw the purpose of this war aside from profit pushing for Lockheed Martin, Boeing, etc. Most of the 9/11 terrorists were actually from Saudi Arabia, let's go attack a country where Osama Bin Laden might be hiding in a cave? As well as the fact that getting those vehicles back to America or even to an ally of America, say France, would have cost significantly more than any of that used stuff is worth.

That's why societies developed the way that they did going from polygamy with multiple wives in its earliest stages.  But when we started foolishly enforcing monogamy, it did a few things.  In the case of women, it left a huge number of the population without no option for romantic attachment.  And you can't eliminate the psychological need for that sort of attachment in someone.  So women embraced bisexuality much more so over the past few centuries.

Now, don't misunderstand me.  I'm not saying that monogamy is foolish.  It's quite the opposite.  It's a good thing that has proven to be very beneficial.  When I say that we ""foolishly enforced monogamy"" the foolishness I refer to is the way we enforced it, not monogamy itself. We branded women, ostracized them, sometimes even executed them, and more.  That was the wrong way to go.  In doing that, we enshrined the idea that bisexuality or homosexuality is an oppressed class.  Well, it absolutely was.  It's not anymore and hasn't been for longer than anyone living today has been around.  But that idea is still ingrained in our collective consciousness.

As word filters back from their friends, fathers, cousins, brothers, uncles, coaches, and friends of the family, these potential recruits are staying away in droves, as they should.  The single biggest factor in whether or not a person will be willing to serve is whether or not they know someone who served and whether or not they respect that person.  The military has been drawing almost all of it's force from certain areas for over a generation.  It's gotten to the point it was even getting to be certain families where almost all of the members of the family served.",intelligentreviews

Since everyone is transitioning to more EV vehicles it just makes sense to eliminate problematic elements from all their cars since so many parts are interchangeable across models.

No, I dont want WW3, but I don't to be united state of Russia or china either.

Don’t you blame Biden as US faces changing tides on global stage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12jpudw/dont_you_blame_biden_as_us_faces_changing_tides/,worldisbraindead,"I blame the Republican ""leadership"" for *willfully* sitting on their hands in 2020 and ignoring the obvious. I blame the FBI for *hiding* the truth about Biden and his drug addict son as well as their pressuring Twitter and Facebook and all other social media to quash any story unfavorable to Biden. I blame the DOJ for *refusing* to allow the pretty substantial amount of hard evidence and sworn testimony to be presented in any court. I blame the media for *gaslighting* the public and not doing their job as actual journalists trying to get to the truth...

But, I don't know if I blame Biden himself. He's just a senile old man who can't put two sentences together and routinely sh#t's in his pants. In some ways, it's like watching my father in the last year of his life suffering from dementia. He didn't know what was going on. He didn't even know his children's names. So, why would I blame him for anything?",yuri_2022

Disney cannot logistically leave Florida. It would take *years* probably just to secure new land, never mind breaking ground on anything. Then would they seek to ""pack up"" as much of Disney World as possible and truck it to the new location? Would they even be able to sell the Florida land and attractions? How long could that take?

Trump didn't take Disney's side.  At no point did he ever defend Disney or any of their woke nonsense.

What he **did** do was point out two obvious things.  First, continued fights with Disney could ultimately devastate the economy of Florida if Disney decides to leave.  Second, he pointed out that DeSantis has yet to do anything regarding the squatting laws and the ongoing problem with squatters in Florida. 

Both of these things are 100% true.  There's a lot of prudence in taking the initial wins against Disney and moving on to something else.  It's becoming legally questionable if DeSantis could win a case against Disney at this point because it is definitely becoming a purely political fight.  And you can't bring cases against people because you disagree with their politics if you are the government, which DeSantis is. 

Stop the breathless nonsense.  Trump absolutely took horrible positions in recent history, so don't think for one second I'm going to give him cover.  But in **this** case, he's not picking sides.  He is merely pointing out the obvious.",RoboNinjaPirate

Budweiser Stock Drops $5 BILLION As Boycott Continues & Gets WORSE,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12kt766/budweiser_stock_drops_5_billion_as_boycott/,Comprehensive-Tell13,"Cap rate is the amount of stock × price and has nothing to do with the financial status of a company. You can have a totally broke company and have a high cap rate.

The price is solely dependent on what people are paying for it.  If the price was zero the cap would be zero. 

It drives me crazy 🤪 when people say a company is in good shape just because it has billions in the stock price or cap rate.

A totally broke company will survive on the price people are paying for their stock. A public sell off of a stock where there is no one buying will rapidly drop the price. if a company has no money to buy it back it's compounded.

And bam just like that you are completely broke. The only companies that survive a sell off are companies that don't  need the stock to have a good bottom line. In otherwords a company that separates the business from the stock. Unfortunately that is not the case in quite a few.

Given those factors look at something bidin and the democratic party has said. They have said that they want to illegalize buy backs.  If you did that what happens is you put companies that has cash to buy back in the exact  situation as those that don't. Meaning that a massive sell off will completely bank rupt any and all companies that depend on the stock. And those that don't can't inreach them selves buy buying back at a discount. 

Good for the person that has a lot of cash to buy. sucks for anyone that had their life savings in a stock at the time of the sell off.",intelligentreviews

Pretty much spot on. This is what threatens to rip America apart. 

My fear is either:

+ he does not get the nomination. He then claims fraud and goes through some crazy gymnastics that ultimately tears the Republican Party apart

* he gets the nomination, and loses the election, again. He then claims fraud, and tears America apart, again 

* He gets the nomination AND wins the election. The next 4 years will be chaos, governed without regard to senate or house input, gutted systems (DOJ, FBI, anything else he’s pissed at) and consumed with revenge and a personal vendetta",SaraACarter

It goes beyond that. There is actual court precedence that the PRA provides no criminal statutes for the disagreement between a POTUS/former POTUS and the NARA over records. The PRA specifically states that POTUS has the sole authority to determine which are presidential records and which are personal records, has the right to possession of those records, and the NARA's only recourse to resolve a disagreement is **civil action**. The PRA gives the DOJ no standing for criminal investigations or prosecutions.",intelligentreviews

Just conjecture, but Republican polling, ones that are more in line with Republican and Conservative voters do not show DeSantis cracking Trump's +15 advantage, and it grows with every new establishment figure entering the race. This infatuation by the establishment media with covering Desantis, for example Fox News having him on almost daily, and liberal news' nonstop coverage of his state level actions and ""possible"" national implications, is very interesting to see when he has yet to declare he is running but they claim he is the *the guy* for 2024.

NM Educator: Parents Have No Rights In Public Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/121lw3e/nm_educator_parents_have_no_rights_in_public/,qwertyrdw,"I also want to comment on the last three slides in which he discusses Critical Race Theory. Why is someone who lacks a degree in history commenting on the field without an iota of authority? Of course, a lawyer is going to quote a SCOTUS justice as if lawyers are somehow injected with the sum total of human knowledge upon degree conferral. John Paul Stevens earned a B.A. in English before heading on to law school. Stevens declaring that ""history is not an objective science"" matters not an iota. First, because he is stupid. A science that lacks objectivity is not a science, it is something else. Second, because he lacks a degree in history, and, therefore, lacks a thorough understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the field and how it has evolved over about the last 2500 years. The vast majority of historians praise objectivity as the gold standard in the field to which all should aspire.

&#x200B;

Academia is awash in Critical Theory and Critical Race Theory is under this wider umbrella. Sanchez is under the mistaken belief that the concepts of systemic oppression, White privilege and male privilege are of historical significance. In actuality, these terms are truly nothing more than buzzwords.

– ""Education is not indoctrination""

I really hate to break it to this Sanchez guy, but no one believes that education in and of itself is indoctrination. He has just taken down a strawman. The problem is that there are only so many days in a semester to teach a subject--be it elementary, secondary or college--that the instructor must make choices regarding what to include and exclude. The same thing could be said about any form of education or training whatsoever. An instructor is always going to at least assume the audience has a particular set of knowledge already to build off of. If someone is going to teach you how to tie your shoes do they start off with an explanation of why we need shoes and how the shoe evolved in terms of design over the last three hundred years, or does the teacher just show you how to tie shoes with a hands-on demonstration?

– ""Objective and accurate portrayal of history is not CRT""

He is correct here, but what if, in a college course, on American history to 1865, the instructor devotes 8 weeks of instructional time to the ""peculiar institution"" of slavery? The consideration of emphasis is also important. If all periods are not being taught for a relatively equal amount of time, an instructor is plainly revealing bias and the chance for ideology to creep into instructional materials grows.

  
– Being educated is not being “woke""

Depends. If one majored in any kind of course with ""studies"" (except for security studies which is a legit blending if poli sci and history) in its name, there's a good chance they're woke. Majored in sociology? Probably woke. If someone took more than a required distribution in something like ""social justice issues,"" definitely woke.",intelligentreviews

Even if he loses in this court, he'll win on appeal.  And I'll go on record right now with my prediction.

Yeah this whole thing is just a phony political attack over something that's only just a political norm, but it's also a case that was already settled years ago. However, Trump's become so much of a self-destructive narcissist that his actions have left the Republican Party more weakened and more divided than ever. His attacks against Ron DeSantis have been some of the most appalling displays of pettiness, malice, and short-sighted stupidity in political history.

At this point, who really gives a fuck? This will just be like the impeachment trials, the Kim-Jong Un fights, the first Stormy Daniel scandal, and every other damn time this moron walked his way into trouble. It'll be all over the news for a few weeks, and then everyone will look at the next news story for their daily fixings of hot drama to get angry over.

Trump can go fend for himself, and take all of his loyalists with him. Meanwhile, I think the rest of the GOP needs to stop giving Barry Goldwater's screaming tumor so much attention. It's only going to keep this cycle spinning the more we keep feeding into this culture war outrage.",intelligentreviews

...except the only way it was going to get out is if she told everyone.

...and then she broke the agreement to tell everyone anyway.

We need to redefine what a tax-exempt non-profit is.  For example, the Southern Poverty Law Center should not be a tax-exempt non-profit.  It exists to lobby and funnel money to political causes.  The same needs to go for all other similar political entities.  An example on the right would be the National Rifle Association.  These entities should be taxed.  Non-political entities should remain tax-exempt.  So, if you run a food pantry, no taxes.  If you are part of a religious organization that provides natural disaster relief, no taxes.

I don't know how you tax nothing?  Sure, they can take in a bunch of donations but that's not income if it is spent and expenced out. I think only a liberal would think we can tax donations!

I have absolutely no frkn dobt whatsoever that the raid on Trump residence had everything to do with abtaining the documents necessary to forge the current documents we are now being presented with. Hints the words a reason for the presidential act and it's real purpose.

It is so a president can not be framed after office and a president cannot hide something after leaving office. Just like Trump said it's another agency that has become corrupt by a single party to do the exact opposite of it's intention allow one party to hide everything while using against the other.

The other side of that penny is you can't completely kiss everyone's ass to get what you want either they will take advantage of you 

Bidin is a complete failure because he completely blew it on both sides of that penny. in fact bidin is such a failure that not only is he bad on both sides of that penny. He literally has made enemies by treating enemies as friend while scheming against them as if they were enemies. And made enemies of friends by doing the same. 

Bidin is literally the biggest failure of a president in history  period. And just like Trump said he has done more damage to this country than any 5 presidents you can name combined. For those reasons.

Report: DeSantis Quietly Pressuring Florida Congress Members To Stop Endorsing Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12l8d93/report_desantis_quietly_pressuring_florida/,SilverHerfer,">So far, four of Florida’s 20 congressional officials have backed Trump. None have yet endorsed **DeSantis, who is down roughly 30-points** **behind Trump** in polling for the Republican nomination.

Read the room. That goes for everybody. It was decided long ago. 

The more democrats try to destroy Trump, the more the base decides to shove him down their throat to show them they can't d it. The more you complain about Trump, the more the base decides you're RINOs that need to be shown your place. You're spitting into the wind at this point. Whoever else you support, it's time for you to start thinking about 2028.",intelligentreviews

Putting two candidates on the same ticket because they're the most popular does not mean you'll win. 

The ticket is extremely unbalanced in terms of having two socially conservative populists from the same state, who also both happen to serve to very similar cultural niches.

Doubling down on the same guy who cost us three election cycles, and trying to force DeSantis, a guy who Trump has openly mocked, harassed, disavowed, and lied about will only lead to disaster. Not to mention the fact that this ticket does nothing to win over moderates and independents who may be willing to vote for the GOP, but are too worried that the party's leaning too conservatively. 

I will never understand how anybody would consider this as not only something that could actually happen, but somehow a ticket that could actually win. It's basically just political suicide to ensure that we not only lose 2024, but end up tarnishing the reputation of the one of the Republican Party's biggest rising stars.",FredsInternetIsland
