Don’t let Florida and Texas lead the way with their terrible educational standards."
FEMA_Camp_Survivor,"On the first day of Black History Month, the GOP gets it’s wish of watered down American history."
milkfiend,"> After heavy criticism from Gov. Ron DeSantis, the College Board released on Wednesday an official curriculum for its new Advanced Placement course in African American Studies —  stripped of much of the subject matter that had angered the governor and other conservatives.

> The College Board purged the names of many Black writers and scholars associated with critical race theory, the queer experience and Black feminism. It ushered out some politically fraught topics, like Black Lives Matter, from the formal curriculum.

> And it added something new: “Black conservatism” is now offered as an idea for a research project.

What a joke."

nosayso,"A lot of people strongly disagreed with me in a thread sometime last week when I said the College Board would concede and water down the curriculum.

STOP EXPECTING INSTITUTIONS TO STAND UP TO FASCISM.

They want to make money and avoid bad press, that is all.  They do not care about Black History.  They are not educating people for education's sake.  They are an institution that needs funding and needs to sell AP Tests.  They cannot afford to be embattled with right-wing crazies.  This was inevitable, white supremacists won."

hecklerp8,"I'm speaking with a 52 year old friend born and raised in South Dakota. I'm from NJ.  I started to discuss racism in American and the Oklahoma City massacre of black business owners by a white mob. He immediately tells me I'm lying. Then says it's 100% not true. Then I show him a source and he says it can't be trusted. So, I pull up multiple sources and he calls it the liberal media. I then pull up an article from an Oklahoman news source and show him the upcoming remembrance and suddenly he believes me.  He turns and says ""I can't believe I've never heard of this."" Believe it, the GOP controls the curriculum in SD and they can't have their base suddenly exhibiting empathy towards others. This is exactly what DB DeSantis is doing. The rest of the country should tell Florida that they won't get into college without a basic understanding of African American studies. If they can't pass the admissions exam then they cannot attend. One state should not dictate to the rest."
Catzendo,"Is CRT really a theory? Let’s see, an Afro-American women in Texas was sentenced to 5yrs in prison for voter fraud for trying to vote (not actually voting). Meanwhile in Florida a white man just pled guilty to actually voting twice, sentenced to parole. Doesn’t seem like a theory to me."

Loud-Path,"And this is exactly why I push my kids to be the best they can be so they can get the hell out of this country.  This isn't a local school district or what not being affected by a state ruling, this is a national organization that is supposed to be independent of such things.  And conservative states are going to continue to push their ideologies on other states now that they have the supreme court in their pocket, and given our nation's government and populace won't do jack.  Foreign countries may not be much better, but hell at least in France the people are willing to strike and riot as a whole when the government does something objectively stupid.  Here we just turn on the next episode of our favorite reality tv show."
philko42,"> David Coleman, the head of the College Board, said in an interview that the changes were all made for pedagogical reasons, not to bow to political pressure. “At the College Board, we can’t look to statements of political leaders,” he said. The changes, he said, came from “the input of professors” and “longstanding A.P. principles.”

And those professors, understandably apprehensive about possible political pressure against HS teachers who would teach the course, decided preemptive bowing was the best choice.

The Right's goal is is not to get their way by applying political pressure. That could backfire. Their goal is to discourage liberal actions and words by making people fear that political pressure *might* be applied. That way, the Right can claim that they had nothing to do with actions and words stopping."

yodadamanadamwan,Why capitulate to De santis? Why not just not offer AP African American studies in Florida?
TrefoilHat,"Maybe a hot take, but I agree that more conservative viewpoints should be included in a college-level class. Just be sure the content accurately reflects *academic* conservative perspectives and theories, not *political* conservatives' talking points. Let the ideas stand or fall on their merits. The fact that these views are widely criticized by scholars and activists for being unsupported by evidence and for ignoring the ongoing impact of systemic inequalities should also be discussed.

Of course, as a college course it should also cover CRT and intersectionality.

One of my most memorable experiences in AP US History was a structured debate on whether the US instigated the Mexican-American War as a pretext for expansionism. After the debate, the side arguing ""against"" (which included the class valedictorian) admitted it was a tough position to take because it was so clear the US started the war.

It was a very eye-opening insight into US history. That's the way great learning is done."
RedLicoriceJunkie,"This is all Political dog whistling to Republican voters.  

Why is BLM or Black Feminism more controversial to be student thought than say Malcolm X and the Black Panthers?

I will tell you why.  Because BLM and Black Feminism have a more direct line to political engagement, than Malcolm X and the Black Panthers.  But both the Panthers and Nation of Islam / Malcolm X had a more assertive view and sought more assertive means to Black Equality.  The Panthers and Nation of Islam were doing more than marching peacefully in the name of equality, which is ostensibly what BLM marches are.

BLM simply contends an indisputable fact: Black Lives Do Matter.   But this concept is in the political fore-brain of Republican (and some independent) voters."
phx32259,While this is totally outrageous I find it amusing that in the future people like DeSantis will be a topic in Black history when it comes to 21st century censorship of black history. Maybe his grandchildren will have to write an essay about how DeSantis helped make Black history a core part of American history in his efforts to erase it.
javi2591,Massachusetts needs to send a message to AP curriculum program and tell them we will not accept this watered down garbage. How dare they censor James Baldwin and Bayard Rustin's contributions to Black liberation. WTF is wrong with these professors? Florida does not dictate to the country Black history. This is ridiculous! I want my governor to do something. Call your local officials!
mrnonamex,Florida should have no say when it comes to education.
inkstainedquill,This is a good opportunity to remind everyone that The College Board technically a 501c(3) but the CEO still makes over 1 million dollars and has tried to run a monopoly on advanced studies in high schools and college testing for decades.
bodiddlysquat26,"Maybe I’m not paying close enough attention, but why isn’t the DOJ/Biden doing much about Ron stomping all over Florida banning shit, firing people, etc.? Seems like he’s had free reign to do as he pleased and no one really fights back. 

There was that one guy who won his lawsuit for wrongful termination, but the court was like “congrats you won, but we can’t do anything to reinstate you lol”

Even if they can’t legally do something to stop him, why aren’t national Dems ringing the alarm more about this? This guy is going to run in 2024 and the longer you paint him as a fascist extremist, the better."

WoundedKnee82,"And a Happy Black History Month to you too!

>The dispute over the A.P. course is about more than just the content of a high school class. Education is the center of much vitriolic partisan debate, and the College Board’s decision to try to build a curriculum covering one of the most charged subjects in the country — the history of race in America — may have all but guaranteed controversy. If anything, the arguments over the curriculum underscore the fact that the United States is a country that cannot agree on its own story, especially the complex history of Black Americans.

>In light of the politics, the College Board seemed to opt out of the politics. In its revised 234-page curriculum framework, the content on Africa, slavery, reconstruction and the civil rights movement remains largely the same. But the study of contemporary topics — including Black Lives Matter, incarceration, queer life and the debate over reparations — is downgraded. The subjects are no longer part of the exam, and are simply offered on a list of options for a required research project."

Myself and other ""asshole atheists"" like the Atheist Experience (from Austin Public Broadcasting) and the Freedom From Religion Foundation were making a big stink about how Texas school boards were making changes to textbooks to say that America is a Christian nation and other such a-historic garbage. The problem is that the books produced for Texas students were then sold to other states, which continued the cycle of misinformation.

DeSantis and Abbott have been given a fresh new 4 years to do this shit, and they are just getting started. They didn’t hide their true nature either and we had 4 years or more already to know who they are. Abbott has been in government for at least a decade, if not two, now.

Important_Sound5151,"Are we preparing college students to be intellectuals or dunces? Being an intellect is not about getting 4.0 GPA (which means nothing today based on our unscrupulous education system) it is about your ability to use knowledge you have acquired to make factual arguments and solve problems. Therefore, knowledge should not be subjected to anyone or group’s decision to ban or water-down  pertinent information which is intellectual sound. Furthermore, whether you are an individual or a country your history is your guide into the future. It helps you to avoid mistakes; mend broken promises or strife and resolve difficult situations.
Moreover, the education system has already diluted students’ ability to argue at an intelligent level when educators began to place emphasis on tests rather than lifelong learning. Students of higher learning need more information not less. They will be taking over a broken system of divisiveness and social deprivation. Therefore, they need all the tools to face the turbulences which are inevitable in the future."

3Quondam6extanT9,So we should all be suing the college board?
tomuchpasta,The amount of effort to hide and obfuscate history in the age of the internet is so hilariously stupid only conservatives could think it will work. You could send out a mass text message with links to relevant historical materials and reach more people than this AP course does.
Jaway66,What a bunch of fucking cucks.
bndboo,Wow! It’s almost as if The College Board only exists for the profit of shareholders.
thesnuggyone,This makes me so *fucking angry*. I really really can’t stand this. I feel so powerless.

The82ndDoctor,"Shit, I'm just going to screen out anyone who graduated from Florida after 2022 while hiring from now on. Not worth the trouble."
TantalusComputes2,What a disgrace. I want my money back from this shitty company
eddie422000,"This is what freedom under corrupt Republican religious oppression looks like. You are free to think what I tell you you can think. We will ban all other thoughts and ideas. Vote them out before they take your vote away too.

They are in bed with the commies from Russia and want to rule without consequence. Stop them or pay the price of freedom!"
UtgaardLoki, Dolores Umbridge has taken over the College Board
Educational_Permit38,The not so slow March of DeSantis fascism. Pretty darn scary since people seem to be caving in rather than fighting back.
kevinnoir,Women in Florganistan better get their uni degrees now because its looking like the GOP is going full Taliban

> In light of the politics, the College Board seemed to opt out of the politics.

> Most four-year colleges and universities grant college credit for students who score high enough on an A.P. exam.

> The fracas over the exam raises questions about whether the African American Studies course, as modified, fulfills its mission of mimicking a college-level course, which usually expects students to analyze secondary sources and take on contentious topics.

SissyFreeLove,"Fuck em. Every body should refuse to utilize AP until they correct this mistake. Allowing the far right to dictate education is ridiculous and shouldn't be allowed. The history of black Americans is American history and should be taught as such. Not this ""can't let my kids find out how shitty we treated black people. They might end up not being as racist as I am"" bullshit."
workingtoward,Decent colleges now need to announce that AP classes will no longer receive college credit since they are no longer college-level classes.
superflossman,"Weird. I wonder where all those people who were angry about the removal of Confederate statues because ""you can't erase history"" went..?"
Disciple_of_Cthulhu,Why does the College Board care about the opinions of the governor of literally the stupidest state in the nation?

The College Board should instead have had the gumption to stick to its educational goals"
CanWeTalkEth,Cowards and fascists. What are they scared of?
justforthearticles20,Entire Curriculum going forward: African Americans are Americans that can trace some or all of their ancestry to Africa.

PrncssVahallaHawkwnd,"What the actual fuck is happening to America???! I just keep feeling this over and over in my bones, like really, what the fuck is happening?? How have we gone this far backwards this quickly? How the fuck does it keep looking and feeling like these people are winning and just NO ONE is stopping them? I get so angry and sad and at first it was like a fluke, but then every week and now every day something horrendous happens and its just not stopping. So many public shootings, cops killing people continuously, horrible dehumanizing anti-abortion laws, so much shit with anti lgbtq or anti-anything other than white Christian on and on and on EVERY FUCKING DAY NOW, and its not stopping or slowing down-in fact it looks like its picking up speed and gaining momentum. What the actual fuck is happening and when is this going to stop? Is it even going to? Are we ever going to go forward from this or is this it and we have to have like an actual civil war to stop these people? This is fucking insane to me."
sagenumen,"Letting anti-education Conservatives dictate curriculum. Brilliant.

As an aside, I just looked at my high school's website and they are phasing out AP courses, while building their own advanced curriculum in partnership with several universities. Their own offerings are expected to start in Fall 2024. They specifically note that fewer colleges and universities are offering credit for AP courses and I can't imagine a change like this would help that trend. Sucks for College Board."
SmackSabbath19,GQP are devolivng into base animals
smkmn13,"Also, wtf NYTimes with that subheadline: ""After criticism from Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, the official course looks different: *No more critical race theory*, and the study of contemporary topics — like Black Lives Matter — is optional."" (emphasis added)

Simply mentioning Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw wasn't ever including CRT, and removing her doesn't mean anyone removed it. Stop supporting the right-wing outrage machine's favorite educational target."
Ok-Ease7090,Goddammit. Don’t  appease the fascists.
