Ever since the indictment he's been on this rant, complaining that the Stormy Daniels case shouldn't be the one we get Trump on because it's the weakest of the ones currently running their coarse.

Well who gives a damn which one he's indicted for? Did Bill forget the part where no one person is above the law? Because talking about it as if we should've *chosen* the more important cases totally undermines that argument.

By picking and choosing the ""better"" case, you make the legal system look like a justice buffet. *This* is what he's guilty of, so we charge him. Period.

If you wan't to make the Republican's case for them, there's no better way than by being selective about which one he's indicted for.

When unaligned voters look at the parties and see one being selective about how the law is applied, it's not hard to predict how they'll feel about it.

I used to think Bill was pretty smart. But after this boneheaded position he's taken, I realize I was wrong.

How does he not get that even if we had a choice as to which one we started with, *this* is the smartest one. Because now that this relatively lesser case has punctured the illusion of Trump's legal invulnerability, the others just get stronger as we go.

This is the right path, and the smartest path. But it's not the right path *because* it's the smartest one. It's the right path because it's the right path.",Correct-Echo9533

**""We don't care what you think because you don't show up to vote anyway.""**

And they're not wrong. Their strategies are built on prior election data - both Presidential and local/state/midterms. Voters outside of Baby Boomers - especially in ""red"", ""purple"", or ""battleground"" states/districts fail to consistently show up at the polls in reliable volumes. 

**Any voter turnout for ANY election below 60% is terrifying and that past inaction - even as recently as 2022 - is why everything has been fucked over.**

If this infuriates you as a voter, good. But it's not enough for you to vote. It's not enough for you to vote consistently for the next 50 elections at all levels. We need to infuriate and motivate/mobilize as many individuals as we can muster and ensure that they're registered and that they prioritize exercising their right to vote in all elections on all issues, for all offices, for the remainder of their lifetime.

Any apathy or hesitancy to commit to that responsibility is a passive acknowledgment that they have no complaints about the current state of affairs and that they don't care if it gets worse. 

We each have a duty to impress upon those in our sphere of influence how we git here and how **it will become worse if we don't fix the problems** that we caused with poor voter turnout for decades. This. Is. Not. Hyperbole. The evidence is crushing us now. Despite decades of dismissal and accusations of overreacting or doomsaying.

*The unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn…*

*You can love the unborn and advocate forthem without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe.*

*Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.*

Their entire careers are based on *claiming to speak on behalf of a superbeing*.  That's their starting point.  Literally a grift.

The whole ""buT tHe pOOR bAbiEs!!!1111"" line was specifically engineered to create a buffer zone around them - something the non-religious would have to ""debate,"" deflecting them away from the core issue - religious interference in governance.

>""The free man will ask neither what his country can do for him nor what he can do for his country. He will ask rather ""What can I and my compatriots do through government"" to help us discharge our individual responsibilities, to achieve our several goals and purposes, and above all, to protect our freedom?   
  
(The other half of the quote is wacky, though, you can skip it.)  
  
Still, I like this part, and it stands out compared to the Republican philosophy of governance, which amounts to ""How can we force people to take more 'personal responsibility?'""  (Using *their* definition of ""responsible,"" of course.)   
  
Likewise the freedoms that they deem us to use irresponsibility, like voting for Democrats for instance, are the freedoms they most want to take away from us.  Which is ironic to me, because I've always felt that voting in my own self interest ***is*** an act of personal responsibility.  
  
But I like Freedman's framing: ""What can I and my compatriots do through government to *help us?""*  Isn't that what we created government for in the first place?  To be an extension of the will of the people?  To be a ***tool*** of the people?  And today an entire political party insists the only thing that tool is good for is gathering rust.  SMH my head.

If I read it correctly the list of terms only includes some outdated slurs for trans people and femboy.

Not only is femboy really not necessarily the same subject, but of course out of touch conservatives are gonna use negative language for it.

It's not looking at political bias among people searching trans porn. It's looking at political bias among people searching for trans porn with the vocabulary of a conservative uninformed bigot. Of course the result is politically skewed.

But if we include better terminology, like trans and transgender, you'd include back in all of the moderate and liberal people who search for trans porn, too. From that total dataset we could get a better idea of bias among people doing searching.

What an episode of The Office THAT would make. 

Michael Scott is inspired after reading ""The Little Prince"" to suggest a new product name in the annual corporate suggestion competition. Combining the words ""femto"" (a very small thing) and ""boyar"" (a member of aristocracy next in rank to a prince), he seeks to gain traction in the competition by placing targeted ads with the major search engines for Dunder Mifflin FemBoy with hilarious consequences.

But seriously, now. There is legitimate science behind the different-sex-bashing = in the closet and excited by that stuff. The research was done with gay porn but it looks like this applies too.

There's a medical device that can measure when a man's ...well, manhood... was swelling with blood. Take one of those and subject volunteers to certain stimulating situations (say, some good ol' fashioned pr0n) to see what excited them. And make sure you get a good broad spectrum of where they stand politically, so you know whether there's a connection between vocally hating gayness and secretly having the gayness and such as, or not.

[The scientific name for such a device is a plethysmograph.](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003771.htm) And there is indeed a penile plethysmograph used in medicine...

[I'll cut to the chase: yes. It looks like they angry cos they horny.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/u47/Henry_et_al.pdf)

>The authors investigated the role of homosexual arousal in exclusively heterosexual men who admitted negative affect toward homosexual individuals. Participants consisted of a group of homophobic men (n = 35) and a group of nonhomophobic men (n = 29); they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W. W. Hudson & W. A. Ricketts, 1980).

>The men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual, male homosexual, and lesbian videotapes, and changes in penile circumference were monitored. 

We have the technology...

>A mercury-in-rubber (MIR) circumferential strain gauge (Bancroft, Jones, & Pullan, 1966) was used to measure erectile responses to the sexual stimuli. When attached, changes in the circumference of the penis caused changes in the electrical resistance of the mercury column, which were detected by a Parks Model 270 Plethysmograph (pre-amplifier; Parks Electronic Laboratory, Beaverton, OR). The pre-amplifier output was channeled into a Grass polygraph. Tumescence responses were recorded on the chart drive of the
polygraph and were channeled to an analog-to-digital (A-to-D) interface connected to an IBM computer.

And yes, they covered the bases with what got the men going.

>The stimuli were 4-min segments of explicit erotic videotapes depicting consensual adult heterosexual activity, consensual male homosexual activity, and consensual female homosexual activity. The sexual activity in the videos included sexual foreplay (e.g., kissing and undressing), oral-genital contact ( e.g., fellatio or cunnilingus), and intercourse (i.e., vaginal penetration, anal penetration, or tribadism in the lesbian film). The lesbian videotape was included because it has been shown to be highly sexually arousing to heterosexual men and is a better discriminator between heterosexual and homosexual men than other stimuli (Mavissikalian, Blanchard, Abel, & Baflow, 1975 ).

What you're looking at is the three graphs, each with two lines on them. Three graphs for the three types of video, two different types of line for the homophobic and nonhomophobic groups.

>Figure 1. Stimulus presentations by groups across time blocks. The only significant difference between groups is with the homosexual video. The blocked line represents the nonhomophobic group; the solid line represents the homophobic group. Top: Heterosexual video; middle: lesbian video; bottom: homosexual video.

Results?

>The results of this study indicate that individuals who score in the homophobic range and admit negative affect toward homosexuality demonstrate significant sexual arousal to male homosexual erotic stimuli. These individuals were selected on the basis of their report of having only heterosexual arousal and experiences.

They get a rise (pun specifically intended) from the porn they claim to be against: ""significant sexual arousal to male homosexual erotic stimuli"".

Until recently, The Supreme Court tries not to over ride settled constitutional interpretations unless there’s significant grounds to do so. A corrupt right wing justice holding that seat for 25+ years while engaged in corrupt activities that are intended to influence his judgement certainly lays a lot of groundwork for any ruling he took part in to be overturned.

Popular opinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/12g5l0u/popular_opinion/,BurstEDO,"While true, the presentation at the time and the individual presenting the message came off as fear-mongering rhetoric. Clinton was deeply unlikable and her public-facing attitude demonstrated a disconnect between public perception and personal presentation.

I worked in broadcast journalism during the 2008 election and covered an event that was a campaign stop for then-candidate Clinton. Her demeanor was that of a ""superior importance"" public figure who was above the common voter. She came off inaccessible, arrogant, and dismissive of (valid/legitimate) criticism. 

She was also the 2016 target and victim of an insurmountable avalanche of foreign interference coupled with a right wing weaponized propaganda network operating in parallel (maybe even cooperation with) foreign bad actors. For her to have performed as well as she did in the popular vote despite everything thrown at her is _legendary._ 

I personally found her to be aloof, detached, and ""deserving/entitled"" **AT THE TIME.** She came across as performative and ""going through the motions/reading the script"" in order to achieve her personal goal/ambition of achieving the highest political office available. 

But that was exactly what the public campaign of the opposition hammered home. So much so that I've repeatedly second-guessed my evaluation. Despite my experience in 2008, I've repeatedly questioned my evaluation of 2016 candidate Clinton as flawed, misinformed, and influenced by questionable social/broadcast media habits and reliance. I now believe that my perception of candidate Clinton was faulty and the result of an unprecedented effort to derail the momentum of progress as cultivated by Obama AND his Democrat colleagues. An effort to usurp the progress made and regress the country backwards into the 1950s along with the regulations and laws that enabled that progress. Meaning billions in lobbying, campaign spending, foreign interference, and REPUBLICAN king-making ... all of which Clinton rightly warned of. And all of which too many of us were too stupid, dismissive, and arrogant to heed. 

At the time, a Clinton presidency was viewed by some (myself and some other non-Republicans) as a groan-worthy runner-up to a historic Obama tenure. The 2016 Democrat Party had a messaging/image/unity issue. In retrospect, those of us who were disappointed by Clinton's nomination were ultimately part of the problem and part of the cause behind her 2nd place finish. We underestimated the GOP and mistook the race as ""lesser of 2 evils."" No - there was only ever one evil, and it was NEVER Clinton. Clinton was right - she and her peers warned of this and it was mistaken by voters as doomsaying rhetoric. 

It will now require the vigilance, sacrifice, and diligence of at least the remainder of my Gen X lifetime to repair the damage done by failing to heed Clinton's warning. It will require decades of voter turnout - even against the onslaught of voter suppression - to dismantle the framework installed as a consequence of the 2016 election. 

And our first duty is to ensure a Democrat sweep of 2024, regardless of polls and personal preference. If Biden receives the nomination, everyone must be all-in on Biden at that point or risk even more dire consequences. A GOP win in any race is now a threat to our way of life; our Democratic process.",swazal

Dianne Feinstein faces resign calls after missing 60 Senate votes in 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/12jtlv3/dianne_feinstein_faces_resign_calls_after_missing/,CharmCityCrab,"I see some personal criticisms of Senator Feinstein here, and my feeling is that people wouldn't phrase things in the way that they are if they knew something that I thought was common knowledge among people who follow politics.  So, in that spirit, I'm going to share a little information here that's already public but that wasn't mentioned in the article and isn't getting much play in the press.

Senator Feinstein's mental condition has been deteriorating for years.  I don't have access to her health records, so I don't know if she has a diagnosed health condition, but it seems likely to be some sort of dementia.  Her aides and former aides from recent years have told stories that make it obvious that she's not with it.  After a disastrous performance in the Amy Comey Barrett confirmation hearings that ended in her praising Lindsay Graham profusely, Senator Schumer quietly behind the scenes lobbied her to resign her role as the lead Democrat on the committee before the Democrats formally retook the Senate, so she wouldn't be chairperson of the committee.

In addition to having to agree not to take the gavel of the committee on which she had been the senior Democrat, I have noticed that Senator Feinstein also isn't the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, a mostly honorary position that typically goes to the most senior member of the chamber's majority party (Which is her), but which is also fourth in the line of Presidential succession behind the President, Vice-President, and Speaker of the House.  She obviously couldn't be put in the line of succession, and so she isn't- I don't know the precise details, whether they went to her and asked her to agree to decline the position or just decided not to give it to her (It's not actually guaranteed to the senior member of the majority party- that's just usually who gets it), but she clearly isn't in that position for the same reason she isn't the Chairperson of the Judiciary Committee.

This all happened before 2023, which is the year the article cites as her missing 60 votes due to physical infirmary.

My point in saying all this is just that she's not playing with a full deck, so people going after her for not resigning may not be being fair in the sense that she may no longer be mentally capable enough to know that she should resign due to her mental and physical deterioration.  She's probably not culpable.  In some ways, she probably isn't mentally the same person she used to be.

There really isn't a way to just kick a member out other than through expulsion, which is a process that is used for people due to their moral turpitude, which is not the issue with her.  I don't think there would be the votes to do that to someone with health issues who hasn't committed some sort of grave crime or engaged in some sort of egregious public behavior.  It's not a precedent other Senators want to set, lest it be used against them one day.

What can be done is removing her from the judiciary committee (replacing her with another Democrat) so we can resume getting as many judges as possible confirmed before a potential Republican takeover of the Senate in January of 2025.  That's something Senator Schumer could do right now, and if political pressure through phone calls or letters is going to be put on someone to do something about this situation who actually can, you'd want to write or call Senator Schumer's office.  To some extent, other Democratic Senators are his constituents (i.e. They vote on who their leader is in the chamber), so one could also contact the office of their Senator(s) about this issue (If any of the Senators in their state are Democrats), though they may just say it's Senator Schumer's decision.

She'll likely be 1 of 100 Senators until January 2025 when her replacement takes office, since her term expires at the end of the 2024 and she isn't running for re-election.  She'd have to resign not to be, and it doesn't appear as though she will.   Unfortunately, there's no [25th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv) Section 4 for Senators.

In an overall Senate with a very small margin, it would be best to have a new Senator from California, which will happen in less than two years automatically, but for which there is no mechanism to force.

However, she can be removed from the judiciary committee, and all committees, tomorrow, and that's what I think Senator Schumer should do.

It's a tough thing because many of the people in the Senate are her friends, or people who grew up admiring her and launched their political careers in part because of the inspiration they drew from her when she was one of the lions of the Senate.  There's an emotional component to this that a lot of reports are missing, but that is key to fully understanding the situation.  A lot of her colleagues really don't want to embarrass her or take actions that seem to censure her.  But at this point, I think they have to do what is within their power to do.",Randomlynumbered

And support for the former president himself seems to have become a major dealbreaker for many.“I think that there are very few issues that are really dealbreakers in relationships for most folks, even for folks that identify as quite liberal,” said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life. “But again, Trump is an absolute dealbreaker.”Surveys back up that claim. More than 70 percent of Democrats who were single and looking would not consider dating someone who voted for Trump, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center poll — much larger than the share who said they wouldn’t date a Republican.

Speaking as a guy, I'm open to dating a never-Trumper, and *maybe even* a Libertarian or a Green Party voter. But Trump-voting women are a hard no. The people who still support him (despite his legal troubles, his bigotry, his immature behavior, etc.) are part of a cult, and are not normal.

One of the most obvious takeaways from Donald Trump’s time in the White House—in addition to the determination that (1) people working for him should have received hazard pay and (2) he should never be allowed within 10,000 feet of the place again, not even as a chaperone for a school trip—was that the then first lady, Melania Trump, absolutely despised him. And it appears those feelings have not changed in the two-plus years since the duo left Washington!

According to a new report, Melania remains “angry” at her husband over the alleged affair he had with porn star Stormy Daniels, which could result in his being indicted by the Manhattan district attorney’s office at some point in the near future, thanks to the hush money he paid to keep Daniels quiet in 2016. (Though the ex-president has denied sleeping with the adult-film star, he has admitted to the $130,000 deal brokered by his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen on the eve of the 2020 election, which Trump subsequently reimbursed Cohen for during his first year in office.) And while it doesn’t seem unreasonable for Melania to still be upset about her husband allegedly cheating on her—just months after she gave birth, according to Daniels—her negative feelings for him apparently run so deep that she doesn’t seem to give a fuck if he is criminally charged. The former first lady, a source familiar with the matter told People, “wants to ignore” the whole thing and “hopes it will pass,” but “doesn’t sympathize with Donald’s plight.”

Not only that, but, according to the same source, the former FLOTUS really wouldn’t be put out in the slightest if her spouse did time behind bars. “Melania loves the beautiful weather and resort town atmosphere of Palm Beach,” this person told reporter Linda Marx. “She is happy when she is in Palm Beach. She has her son and other close family members. They are tribe-like and usually stick together. Despite what happens to Donald, she will be fine. She is well taken care of.”

In related news, it appears that at least two other family members won’t be holding any press conferences to decry the potential charges or claim Trump is the victim of witch hunt. According to the New York Post, former senior presidential advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner “want nothing to do with this. They are staying away and don’t want to be hounded by reporters. I don’t think you will see them defending him—it will be no comment.” (In November, despite his reported begging, Ivanka declined to show up when her father announced his third bid for office, later saying in an official statement that she would not participate in his campaign.)

Obviously, this all stands in contrast to the online ravings of Donald Trump Jr., who seems prepared to chain himself to the door of the Manhattan DA’s office until prosecutors agree to leave his dad alone.

No word from Eric Trump, though his stance is presumably somewhat more in line with Don Jr.’s Don’t worry, Dad, I’m going to sneak you out through the prison tunnel system! vibe than his stepmother’s POV.",Souled_Out

- A judge delayed the trial the night before opening arguments were expected to begin.

- Court filings have already produced embarrassing revelations about Fox hosts, executives, and producers.

Fox is pushing to settle a mammoth defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems just before it was about to head to trial, according to multiple reports.

On Sunday night, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis, who is presiding over the lawsuit, said in a statement that the trial would begin on Tuesday, instead of Monday morning as scheduled. He didn't explain the reasons for the move.

Fox made a last-minute attempt to settle the case out of court, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. The Journal first reported on the settlement talks. Reuters also reported that Fox sought to settle the case, citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter.

According to the Washington Post, lawyers for both sides are scheduled to meet on Monday to determine if they can broker a last-minute deal.

A spokesperson for Fox Corp., the parent company of Fox News, declined to comment to Insider on the record. A spokesperson for Dominion declined Insider's request for comment.

The twist effectively dampers what has been widely anticipated by First Amendment experts to be a reckoning for the right-wing media outlet in Delaware Superior Court.

Dominion first filed its lawsuit, asking for $1.6 billion in damages, in March 2021. It alleges Fox News and Fox Corp. defamed it when it hosted conspiracy theorist lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who spouted falsehoods about the company to millions of viewers in the aftermath of the 2020 election.

Former President Donald Trump, refusing to accept that he lost the presidential election, hired Powell and Giuliani in a failed effort to reverse his loss in the courts.

Powell and Giuliani pushed a false theory that Dominion — in cahoots with the rival election technology company Smartmatic — had convoluted ties to the dead Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and secretly flipped votes from Trump to now-President Joe Biden. Dominion alleges that Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo, and Lou Dobbs either endorsed those claims or didn't sufficiently push back against them when they hosted Powell and Giuliani on their shows.

Fox has argued that it was simply reporting on newsworthy claims made by the sitting president. And though defamation lawsuits are difficult to win in the US because of the country's strong free speech protections, First Amendment experts largely agree that Dominion has enough evidence to win the case. The election technology company would have to prove Fox News acted with ""actual malice"" — a legal standard meaning that the media outlet knew it was lying or recklessly disregarded the truth.",Souled_Out

You make it sound like Fox is in the drivers seat. They’re not. So far nothing has gone their way in this case and quite a few avenues in their legal strategy have been closed by the Judge. 

This case has the best chance of cauterizing a cancer that has afflicted our country for two decades. I’m really hoping Dominion see it that way - I know their demands include full on-air retractions - so it seems like the principle matters for them as well as the damages. 

Although the evidence clearly shows that they knew claims of fraud were complete bullshit, their base are unlikely to reading about that given how willfully partisan Conservative media is. Having videos of conservative TV personalities admitting they lie for a living would be so much more valuable. 

So please Dominion - make them grovel on air at the very least. But better still bankrupt them. Deal Murdock a real blow - because it’s clear he’s lost the plot - and do the world a favor.",Souled_Out

You have personal relationships that can become sexual relationships and cohabiting relationships recognized by law as a marriage, boss-worker relationships, work colleague relationships (that may also become sexual relationships etc.), power dynamic relationships (priest to flock, police officer to civilian, teacher or youth pastor or parent to child - one person holds all the power in that dynamic). And of course you have a political relationship between the politician and their constituents.

Lots of variations of relationships, but when it comes down to it there have always only been two types. Healthy (safe, productive, enjoyable), and toxic (stressful, abusive, dangerous).

The Republicans blame people that aren't with them for everything, and never accept blame for causing the issues between them and that other group of people. They claim to be great with money but [they've been the ones not pulling their weight financially for decades](https://www.businessinsider.com/red-states-are-welfare-queens-2011-8) (they will NEVER admit to this fault that's 100% theirs).

And then they complain that these other people don't want to be in a relationship with them.

[Well duh, because it's obviously an abusive relationship. Who wants to be in an abusive relationship?](https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/open-forum-comparing-the-gop-to-an-abusive-boyfriend/article_dc79e0af-a747-53b9-8c7f-d99e0baaf45b.html)

Gen Z is polling as 79% Lib/Left these days. And old age and disease are taking the adherents of the right. It is not a good time for them and their tacticians are very aware of it.

Mother Tucker gins up fear every single day. I agree that threatened groups like minorities and LGBTQ+ should protect themselves with firearms. In fact, in open carry states, the Black Panthers should feel free to arm themselves with the most lethal weapons they can afford without fear of prosecution.

I guarantee you that once all this starts happening, idiot Republicans will start backing off from their right-wing lunacy involving the 2nd Amendment. Unfortunately, a lot of bloodshed will possibly go down before the right-wingers in government decide enough is enough and begin crafting reasonable, common sense gun control laws.

- Former President Donald Trump \predicted a potential arrest last week following reports Bragg was readying an indictment over an alleged hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the probe a witch hunt.

- A staffer for the House Judiciary Committee staffer called Bragg’s office multiple times this week to inquire about requested documents involved in the Trump probe. A staffer for Bragg said, according to a New York Post report, *“Your committee has no jurisdiction over us. You’re wrong. Stop calling us with this bullshit.”*

Bragg’s attorney previously responded to a request from the House Judiciary Committee by calling the request “unprecedented,” but claimed Bragg was willing to have further conversations.

“[We] request an opportunity to meet and confer with committee staff to better understand what information the DA’s Office can provide that relates to a legitimate legislative interest and can be shared consistent with the District Attorney’s constitutional obligations,” Bragg’s attorney, Leslie Dubeck, wrote. 

“Based on your unique role in this matter, we request your cooperation with our oversight of this politically motivated prosecutorial decision,” the request signed by House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan read.

In his own tweet, Jordan blasted Bragg and accused him of simply targeting Trump’s 2024 presidential run.

“The Justice Department wasn’t going to bring this case. The previous District Attorney Cy Vance wasn’t going to bring this case. And even Alvin Bragg himself, when he first gets elected, didn’t want to bring the case. What changed? President Trump on the ballot,” the congressman wrote.",Souled_Out

You use 1 example of many over 20 years, which I would say is correct. So maybe plan on doing more on other examples, and plan to use common design elements to tie them all together as being part of a series.

Maybe something like ""20 years of corruption"" or ""Clarence Thomas' price"" on all of them. I don't know.

Maybe highlight the dollar amount, in this case $500,000. Maybe above that in smaller characters the year, ""2019,"" And then under the dollar amount, also less prominently, the source of the money, then what it was for. Something like:

Foster care is a concern of mine.

As someone who grew up in foster care, my area did not have a foster shelter for kids with special needs aka disabled kids...

We were put in the main juvenile detention center... really great place to put handicapped kids.

I was one of the lucky ones who got put with a family who specializes with special needs kids and have no problem with LGBT kids.

The worst place to put LGBT kids is in a foster shelter where they might suffer traumatic abuse, It is not uncommon for kids to sexually assault each other there.

They hide behind ""Freedom of Religion"" in Evangelical churches.

A documentary on conversion therapy from ABC News:

https://youtu.be/-bwpsoFH-8c

**The video is very graphic**

A boy was tied up and almost beaten to death.

A boy was whipped with a belt with nails and rivets, he sustained permanent injuries from having chunks of his skin torn off.

A boy had a loaded gun pointed to his head, was told to renounce homosexuality or else...

It was insinuated that a lesbian girl was raped or almost raped to try and make her heterosexual.

**When asked by ABC News when this came out a few years ago about this level of abuse and his support of conversion therapy in the past, Vice President Pence had no comment.**",zoeygirl69

There are many in Texas on the front lines helping fight against voter suppression. Helping get candidates elected. Not only does money help but volunteering does too. With computers remote help is doable. Even subscribing will help. I have one of those nonprofits. 501c3.  I am helping candidates get elected statewide. I promote middle class women, Veterans, LBGTQ, and marginalized groups. I help any Dem candidate running across the state. I do not charge voters or candidates but do take donations. Helping turn counties blue. You can find your whole Dem ballot in one place. Bio, photo, work/education background, platform, web links and videos. There are 59 counties without Dem chairs right now that I am posting voter information to and giving them the tools to get organized. I am working on the Judicial section statewide now for 2024. Will do the counties as the candidates commit to run. I truly believe what I am doing is a game changer for voter education.

State house: Best investment if you want to grow Dem power in Texas. There's a lot of small suburban seats that have heavily shifted to the Dem party, with more than 18 currently being held by Republicans that either voted for Biden or Trump by single digits. With the growth in population in those areas and the increasing tendency for highly educated suburban voters to vote D, it's prime areas for flips. Dems only need 12 to flip the the state house. Just look at Cobb county in Georgia if you want to see the change in vote (from R to D) and how that same phenomenon could apply in Texas.

Statewide Executive office: These are the big prizes. Gonna be tough, but in a good Dem year I feel Dems could flip a few of them. The Attorney general and Lt. Gov are big scumbags, even by Texas R standards. Considering Biden lost Texas by 5.6 points, I'd say a 2018 style midterm would clean out a few Rs but it depends on the margins in 2024 and 2028 presidential. I can see at least 1 flipping before 2031 redistricting.

Lower level offices (county or municipal) and judges: They have so much influence despite their positions. There's plenty of suburban seats that have a lot of Rs influencing local policy, so they could be vulnerable in future (especially Collin and Tarrant).",scienceofsin

Ann Richards was the last Democrat elected Governor of Texas.  That was in the 1990s.

Texans (and people who know how locals down there think), would a candidate exactly like Ann Richards be able to get elected in Texas today, in your opinion?

If so, what was it that she had that recent statewide Democratic don't?  Could someone with those views or non-issue intangibles (i.e. a way of speaking or describing issues, a general approach to the office, etc.), or an existing candidate who adopted them, be put forward in a future statewide election?

I'm just being realistic here, because imagine if a bunch of Texans showed up in New York, we'd have no clue what to do, so whatever you do will be far more effective in New York. But... this can help us in Texas, because politics are increasingly national these days. There are young Latino women in Texas who are inspired by AOC's example and are getting involved in politics, and it can be a bonus down the road when she comes to campaign here for Democrats.

New York Democrats should cultivate more young, brilliant and talented people like that.

Why did New York Democrats lose several congressional seats in the last election? I would focus on fixing that problem. That matters more from where you're standing. It's sorta, like, ""lead by example.""

Also focus on economic development. Build a stronger economy in New York that works for more people. Don't get too distracted by the Republicans' ""culture war"" bait, they try to exploit divisive wedge issues because their agenda is to give big tax breaks to their billionaire megadonors. On the other hand, a lot of moderate voters go with the Republicans in Texas because they think the Republicans are good for the local economy. It's a mixed bag overall, I gotta say, because you have to ask yourself ""who really benefits?"" Texas has a lot of poverty, it's kinda shocking. Nevertheless, the impression of the Republicans being good for the economy is quite strong among a lot of these voters.

Also, this doesn't just apply to the Democratic Party specifically, but progressive organizations and forces that are part of the Democratic coalition and which have a presence in New York but are national in scale. I'm talking about the legacy civil rights organizations and organized labor (which is quite weak in Texas) among other social groups and organizations aligned with the Democrats. Texas needs stronger organizations in this coalition that can organize and mobilize people. There are some groups here like the [Texas Organizing Project](https://organizetexas.org/) which I support.",scienceofsin

The second most likely would have been a red flag law. [Shapiro has argued both sides of the red flag law issue](https://www.foxnews.com/media/ben-shapiro-red-flag-gun-control-shootings), so the fact that he's not mentioning it now tells me that he doesn't really care about gun violence, and is using it as vehicle to attack transgendered people.

I get that Shapiro doesn't like trans people because he feels that it's somehow ""wrong"" to be transgendered, but guess what, Ben? Facts don't care about your feelings.

Also...

[Assault weapons cause 85% of the fatalities in mass shootings](https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/hardware-ammunition/assault-weapons/), but Shapiro is vehemently opposed to an assault weapons ban, because he really could not care less about the victims of mass shootings.

[Men are responsible for at least 92% of mass shootings](https://abcnews.go.com/US/guys-guns-men-vast-majority-americas-gun-violence/story?id=79125485). So if we're going to bar any group from owning firearms, it should be men. 

[85% of the people killed by gun violence are men](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html). So using right wing logic, we should have the police stop and frisk men whenever they go out in public and start locking them up if they find weapons or contraband. After all, the cycle of male-on-male violence hurts the male community more than anyone, so we would really be doing men a favor by having police randomly harass them.",DeusBex

A couple of points.
As has been stated before, Disney is just another billions dollar corporation that sucks the life out of its employees and siphons money out its guests pockets. That said, I am elated that Disney outsmarted and outmaneuvered Ronnie “DeSanctimonius”
And this. Disney, even with all their lawyers and business experience, is not a powerful government with diplomats that study and are versed in the art of agreements. That Gov. DeSantis, with the assistance of the Florida Legislature was so utterly and completely duped and blindsided is shocking in the degree of how far they are out of their depth.

I get it with TN, they were wrong, though less for the current expulsions and more for not expelling other legislators for other legal issues to have a better, and-non-racist-seeming leg to stand on.

But those reps are still representing their constituents and the expelled members can be re-elected in the special elections that will happen, which will be an amazing ""fuck you"" to the current reps.

So it isn't about stopping another states government, they have voted for that.

My area of expertise is the content, and... I don't know where to start. I read the article you listed as a source. To say that it's not a good source for the message you're sharing would be an understatement. If anything, it challenges every assertion you make.

For example, ISBA asserts: ""Given the above, stating anything approaching what periodicals like the New Yorker assert (e.g., that 'the amendment conferred on state militias a right to bear arms—but did not give individuals a right to own or carry a weapon.') is simply unsupported by the factual and legal history of the Second Amendment.""

And then there's ISBA's conclusion of ""militia"": ""Based on the above, it is clear that the word 'militia' likely refers to the common-law definition of “militia” set forth by Justice Blackstone—which, as stated, was all private individuals capable of forming groups that would gather together for self-defense.""

ISBA also addressed how the *Dred Scott* case viewed the carrying of arms: ""The Court reasoned that if it held individual African-Americans were entitled to all the rights and benefits under the Bill of Rights, it would be forced to hold them entitled to 'the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which \[every other\] citizen might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.'""

Surprisingly, this article -- which was published in 2017, before the *Bruen* decision -- does a pretty good job of using the text-informed-by-history interpretation for 2A cases that SCOTUS presented in *Bruen*.",ErockLobster

You can't take parts of it and ignore the other parts of the same sentence. Well, I mean you can do whatever you want. I'm not your dad lol. However, it says at the end the right of the people, not the right of members of the militia. It was law that every able bodied man was eligible to be called up to form Militias that Congress calls up to quell insurrection and protect from invasion.

2A is clearly a conditional amendment though. ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free state"" is no longer necessary making the entire amendment null and void

It's interesting how pro-gun liberals praise the European countries for their governments but completely ignore the fact that these countries used to have similar views to militia/gun ownership but evolved past the need for it (except Switzerland).

The 2nd Amendment wasn't something uniquely American, nor an original idea of the founders.  It was based on the long English history of militia, where able-bodied men were required to own bows and master archery and later muskets.  Prior to highly mobile standing armies this had the advantage of quickly mobilizing forces to stall an invading force until the regular army could mobilize.  
The thing is this need really doesn't exist anymore as modern technology and our infrastructure allows our military to be in any location in the USA in a matter of hours.  Additionally now a days an enemy is more likely to strike using missiles, bombs and other artillery which the average citizen isn't equipped to counter.  Every developed nation has pretty much realized this with the exception of the USA.

As for the defense against a ""tyrannical government"".  A legitimate concern but your AR-15 is no match to fighter jets and bombers or ballistic missiles.  I think it's clear that not every citizen is fit to own weapons nor should citizens have access to all types of weapons.  It's an incredible power given to one individual and should be regulated.  

If you want to play soldier and shoot automatic weapons join the National Guard.",ErockLobster

The current SCOTUS interpretation of the ""militia clause"" to be purely preambulatory and not limiting the scope of the right enshrined is, unfortunately, *very* difficult to refute because of how nebulously the thing is phrased.

In any case, the 2nd amendment is not the hill I'm prepared to die on. SCOTUS has made far worse and weirder decisions than Heller. Such as the duo of Roe and Dobbs (wherein Roe was argued in a loose manner that virtually set it up to fail eventually and Dobbs exploited the technical loophole to strip reproductive rights from half the population).",ErockLobster

With Russian support, Jill Stein got enough votes in MI, PA, and WI to give Trump the win. Now, there's the “No Name ”party.

He was the AG for Missouri for about 2 years and turned that office into a financial hole for taxpayers

A review of public records and internal documents, as well as interviews with current and former employees, reveals a chaotic tenure as attorney general that has been costly for state taxpayers. Judges have criticized the office over its slow pace of discovery, and Mr. Hawley’s staff had to renege on a settlement in a high-profile civil case.

Mr. Hawley also quietly closed the environmental division and failed to fully vet one of his top supervisors, who departed after a female attorney in the office complained about his conduct. And his deputies took an unusual approach in an investigation of the governor’s office, largely acceding to demands to limit interviews of the governor’s staff to 15 minutes,--The Governor at that time was Eric Greitens a Republican, who was ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING A WOMAN AND RELEASING SEXUAL PHOTOS OF HER

UNDER HAWLEY

MISSOURI paid $35 million out of its legal expense fund for the 2018 fiscal year, compared with roughly $22 million combined in 2015 and 2016,

There was also massive turn ovver of staff- no one wanted to work under Hawley--All of this was hidden from the public when Hawley ran for congress in 2018

Trump argued that the issue was way too hot to tackle in his first term.  The idea of abandoning NATO in his first term was fraught. There would be far too much pushback from within the US gov, security and military leadership. Not possible. He’d have to wait until his second term. And surely Putin could help make it happen. 

With Trump in power a second term, Putin could ensure a “stand down” by NATO which would have allowed him to take over in weeks. Without military support from the west Ukraine never stood a chance. Zelenskyy says this every day.

No. Partially because some Democrats would end up accidentally sounding like they're attacking all Christians (and some would attack all Christians). And partially because then you have to argue that we're headed towards a theocracy, rather than an outright authoritarian dictatorship with no religious affiliation. Or an oligarchy. So it's in part an abstract political argument about the future of government.

Plus, we need a message that promotes what Democrats are about that appeals to Christians. The best way to call out the right wing evangelicals is to say that Democrats support Jesus's teachings of kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. That we value helping each other. That Democratic Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Humanists, Atheists, etc. all support that. 

But the far-right Christians are not practicing it with their current rhetoric, and by supporting the policies of the GOP. And with this messaging, we can also point out how Trump is a corrupt, greedy, self-centered, immoral politician. Who has never demonstrated any belief in those teachings of Jesus. 

And BTW, that is what turned away my girlfriend from voting Republican. She's a Christian. And she has seen how the Democrats support more Christian values than the GOP.

So we need to make the Democrats the party for tolerant Christians. A large number of Democrats already are Christians. We need to make sure that Christians who are uncomfortable with the way the Republican party and their voters act see Democrats as very hospitable to them.",HercegBosan

But this pronouns issue and attempts to force school systems to invest significant $ in restroom and sports facilities in order to help trans people has brought about a predictable over-reaction by conservatives. The few things they can get their heads around includes anything to do with sex, reproduction, race, and guns. They see guns as their protection against what they consider a repressive govt and the GOP has tapped into this. We're going to have to find a way to attract women voters who are willing to make the jump in order to make a better life for their kids and to take back control of their reproductive lives. This move can really imperil a ""mixed"" marriage politically speaking. I've been there and thankfully my marriage survived. But it was really tough. Right now, all non-Dems notice is trans pronouns, young makes deciding to become females and compete against bio females in sports, Black Lives Matter protests gone wrong, flamboyant Gay Pride parades, new legislation regarding Drag Shows, etc. Bottom line is:The forces, often using religion, to bully anyone ""different"" are large, very strong, well-funded and pretty easily riled.

Bragg Sues Jim Jordan in Move to Block Interference in Trump Case,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/12itqsl/bragg_sues_jim_jordan_in_move_to_block/,Souled_Out,"- Mr. Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, had subpoenaed a former prosecutor who worked on the Manhattan district attorney’s investigation into former President Donald J. Trump.

- The Manhattan district attorney on Tuesday sued Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio in an extraordinary step intended to keep congressional Republicans from interfering in the office’s criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump.

- The 50-page suit, filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, accuses Mr. Jordan of a “brazen and unconstitutional attack” on the prosecution of Mr. Trump and a “transparent campaign to intimidate and attack” the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Bragg last week unveiled 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump that stem from the former president’s attempts to cover up a potential sex scandal during and after the 2016 presidential campaign.

- Lawyers for Mr. Bragg are seeking to bar Mr. Jordan and his congressional allies from enforcing a subpoena sent to Mark F. Pomerantz, who was once a leader of the district attorney’s Trump investigation and who later wrote a book about that experience. Mr. Pomerantz resigned early last year after Mr. Bragg, just weeks into his first term in office, decided not to seek an indictment of Trump at that time.

- Mr. Bragg’s lawyers, including Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. of the law firm Gibson Dunn and Leslie Dubeck, the general counsel in the district attorney’s office, also intend to prevent any other such subpoenas, the lawsuit says. Mr. Jordan has left open the possibility of subpoenaing Mr. Bragg.",Souled_Out

"Clarence Thomas' benefactor, the billionaire megadonor Harlan Crow, has a collection of Hitler artifacts and Nazi memorabilia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/12gajiu/clarence_thomas_benefactor_the_billionaire/,Souled_Out,"- Clarence Thomas benefactor Harlan Crow has an art collection that includes Nazi memorabilia, the Washingtonian reported.

- A visitor to Crow's home also remarked on the numerous statues of reviled 20th Century leaders in his garden.

 - A bombshell ProPublica report revealed that Thomas had taken undisclosed trips funded by Crow for more than 20 years.

Harlan Crow, the GOP megadonor and billionaire benefactor to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, has a collection of Adolf Hitler artifacts and Nazi memorabilia that he keeps at his Texas home, according to the Washingtonian.

The magazine reported that Crow's collection includes two of Hitler's paintings, a signed copy of Mein Kampf, the fascist dictator's 1925 manifesto, other Nazi trinkets, and a garden filled with statues of some of the most reviled leaders from the 20th Century.

Crow has reportedly said he maintains the controversial collection because he despises communism and fascism.

""I still can't get over the collection of Nazi memorabilia,"" an individual who has remained anonymous and who attended an event at Crow's home told the magazine. ""It would have been helpful to have someone explain the significance of all the items. Without that context, you sort of just gasp when you walk into the room.""

The individual said that among the paintings, there was ""something done by George W. Bush next to a Norman Rockwell next to one by Hitler,"" while adding that it was ""startling"" and ""strange"" to view such sculptures at the posh residence.

In 2014, a Dallas Morning News reporter visited the home as part of a public tour of historic homes, where Crow sought to avoid questions about the statues and steer the tour toward his ornate library — along with paintings by Renoir and Monet and sculptures of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.

When the Morning News reporter finally saw the garden of dictator statues, Crow described it as an acknowledgment of the inhumanity that some men have shown to others.

The news of Crow's collection comes after a bombshell ProPublica report, which detailed how Thomas has taken luxury vacations funded by the megadonor for more than 20 years without disclosing the excursions. Two ethics law experts told the publication that Thomas appears to have violated a law passed after the 1970s-era Watergate scandal that requires members of the judiciary and members of Congress to report most gifts.

Thomas, in a response to revelations about the previously undisclosed trips, said that he was advised that it wasn't necessary to report ""this sort of personal hospitality.""

""Harlan and Kathy Crow are among our dearest friends, and we have been friends for over 25 years. As friends do, we have joined them on a number of family trips during the more than quarter century we have known them,"" the justice said in a statement released by the Supreme Court's press office.

Thomas said that going forward, he would follow new guidelines set forth by the Judicial Conference of the United States, which requires that justices report any travel by private aircraft as well as excursions to destinations, including resorts and hunting lodges.",Souled_Out

As of Michigander, I agree. It's the chaos of the GQP in our state that gave the Democrats complete control.

We are still very much a purple state where Republicans might still take back either the governorship, or one of the state legislative branches, in the next election. 

That being said, the governor and our state legislature have been working very hard to pass a lot of legislation. To prove to the people of our state that Democrats will govern. Unlike Republicans who've repeatedly demonstrated that governing is not their main priority.

One was these accusers was 15 years old when he first spoke with Alexander, who wanted “jack off material” from him in exchange for career opportunities and promotion amongst the alt-right. Another accuser said he was 17 when Alexander asked him for a d*ck pic.

Those lies have resulted in an erosion of confidence in US elections, and increased divisions between the right and the left. But if Fox had not mentioned Dominion Voting Systems by name so many times, there would not be a basis for a defamation lawsuit, and we would never have learned of the depth of the hypocrisy and lies peddled by Fox. If Fox had said all of those same lies in reference to voting machines generically, there would be no defamation lawsuit. There would be no motivation for accountability.

If one were to attend a school or correspondence course, and later found that you had been fed lies instead of fact, that would be clearcut fraud, not a matter of First Amendment rights. If not the government, then certainly the journalism community should protest and call out those who pose as journalists, but instead present lies to the public in any media.

Republicans in the U.S. House is apoplectic because they can't get a black prosecutor in NYC to stop investigating and indicting a former Republican president.            

Somehow the concept of ""one person, one vote"" can be trashed by Republicans in order to take over cities with majority black populations, or black leadership. In Florida, if you teach America history that tells the truth about how black people were (are) treated in this country, you can be fired. But there are people who take it as if it's a personal insult when it's pointed out how if black people must be in this country, there are people in charge of systems who feel they must be subjugated and marginalized, and their history rendered invisible. If you live in denial and your reaction is anger when this is pointed out, you're working in the service of the fascist element that's been emboldened by the events of the past 15 years.",maximan2005

I'm sorry, but this is trying to solve last year's problem, and it will have little impact on housing availability in 2023. Merkley's press release cites 2021 data because, by all accounts, the hedge funds that bought up housing in 2021-2022 shot themselves in the foot now that rates went up, and may have to sell a lot of that housing at a loss. They are now buying far fewer homes.

Trying to solve the problem by looking in all the wrong places.

There's nothing inherently wrong with investment funds owning housing. What we actually have to think about is this: *what policies are in place that make housing a desirable holding for these funds at all?*

Restrictive zoning, that's what. When no one can build any new housing, the price of all existing housing goes up. When a company can reliably expect this, buying housing looks like a smart investment.

Of course this also means that even if they *weren't* buying up housing, the cost of housing would still rise. And not necessarily much slower.

De-zone, upzone, deregulate. That's the only sustainable solution.",shallah

But wait a minute. I have books about Hitler, and it isn't because of any stupid admiration for the megalomaniac. ""Know thy enemy."" I also have books about guns, but I am no ""gun nut."" 

Even if the American oligarch does own a Hitler book collection, NO FOUL! HOWEVER, if he used expensive gifts to influence stupid Clarence, that's illegal & should be investigated.

Turning up the heat. That's smart. 

**Typo:** ""event and the all other kickbacks"" should be 

""event and **all the** other kickbacks"" (without the bold)

I do have some constructive criticisms if you're still interested? Sorry to come along this late in the process, and just ignore this if you're happy with the results. 

Visual issues:

It's still a little busy, the spacing between words in the lower case sections is too generous (that's on the font) especially when contrasted with the sections above and below, and the spacing between lines is also weird. The latter matters more because you're getting cute with the font limits rules by adding a variety of font sizes to the mix. I get it, I tend to do that too, but it's not a rule of thumb to be a PITA, it's about legibility, so the spacing becomes even more crucial. If the font you like doesn't do it properly natively, you have to get in there and tweak it by hand, starting new text sections, often with each line, and nudging lines up and down, because right now it makes groupings that don't quite work. Like ""as an unofficial perk of"" is closer to the line above it than the line that follows. It's an issue exacerbated by using an all caps font and following it with your lower case letters that obviously need room above and below where the text is concentrated, so the spacing feels even more off. It just throws the weight off. Make the image smaller and squint at it, and you'll see what I mean. Ideally you try to balance the blurs more. (Also ideally you'd use fonts that require less massaging, but a lot of the free stuff has problems.) Just use guidelines and count the pixels, deduct a little between lower case lines, add a little between the uppers case lines, and it doesn't take too long to fix. 

The IMPEACHTHOMAS font also isn't optimal as you want more legibility on something that's a call to action. It will depend on the resolution most folks are going to be seeing it in, though. If it's on a poster, you're good (although slightly more legible is always better); someone looking at it on their phone, however... I do like that you used a font change here, though. That's a good shift; it subconsciously emphasizes, *here* are the facts, and *this* is what you can do about it. Good use of a font change.",ErockLobster

States like Texas with “no income taxes” still need money. They just get it from different places. But now it’s not tied to your income. Instead, it’s something like property taxes.

To illustrate the problem that creates we can look at Austin. In Austin, property tax rates can be north of 3 percent. The current median home list price in Austin is around 610k. Using those numbers you are looking at around 20k/year in property taxes regardless of income. If you are wealthy, that’s an outstanding deal.

We are calling in sick,  we are not going to stores or restaurants or otherwise participating in the economy. Protest peacefully, stay home or gather,  everyone is welcome to join! We've all been suffering.  


We will not sit by and let people's religion dictate our rights to healthcare.


We will not tolerate the nonsense idea that our body is not our own. 


We want to demonstrate how much society relies on women


We want to impress the importance of reproductive healthcare rights for everyone 


We want to display love and unity to our sisters and brothers in this time. 

 
We want it to be known that we do not accept the legislations created or revoked that force the conjunction of religion and state 


Saying yes to sex is not saying yes to carrying a pregnancy. 


Women's issues are humans issues,  it affects everybody


Abortions are healthcare, and it isn't anybody's business


Teaching sexual education is important to lower the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions

- Judge Peter Cahill sentenced Chauvin to 22 1/2 years after jurors found him guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. 

- Chauvin also faced a separate federal civil rights charge, for which he pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison. He is currently serving his federal sentence in Arizona concurrent with his state sentence.",Souled_Out

Twitter restricts Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's congressional account,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/125dcaj/twitter_restricts_rep_marjorie_taylor_greenes/,MaddyKet,"“Twitter temporarily restricted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's congressional account Tuesday after she repeatedly posted a graphic that referred to a “Trans Day of Vengeance.”

According to a screenshot Greene, R-Ga., posted on her personal account, Twitter said it had “temporarily limited” some of her account’s features, with full functionality scheduled to be restored in seven days.

The post in question, which Twitter has since removed, included a graphic that Greene said was for an antifa event in Washington, D.C., next month.

“Antifa is organizing a Trans Day of Vengeance,"" Greene wrote in accompanying text.

Ella Irwin, Twitter's vice president of product overseeing trust and safety, said the company had conducted a ""sweep"" to remove more than 5,000 tweets and retweets of the graphic, including Greene's.

""We do not support tweets that incite violence irrespective of who posts them,"" Irwin tweeted. ""'Vengeance' does not imply peaceful protest. Organizing or support for peaceful protests is ok.""

According to Irwin, Twitter decided to restrict the graphic from being shared but with “no impact to users for having tweeted it” unless it was “reposted after removal or was posted with additional calls for violence/ wishes of harm.”

Greene’s office shared a copy of the deleted post and Twitter’s communication with her but did not respond to a request for additional comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.

Irwin said ""a high number of users"" reported the graphic Monday, most likely ""due to heightened sensitivity to the language, given the tragic events in Nashville,"" where six people, including three children, were gunned down at a Christian elementary school.

Nashville police said the shooter was Audrey Hale, whom they identified as a transgender former student of The Covenant School. Hale, 28, was killed by police.

In the wake of the shooting, some GOP lawmakers have focused on the suspect’s gender identity amid an intensifying battle waged by some conservatives against transgender people.

Greene has been a vocal critic of transgender rights on Capitol Hill. During her first year in Congress, she placed a sign outside her office mocking a Democratic lawmaker whose daughter is transgender after the Democrat hung a transgender pride flag next to her door. The same year, Greene co-sponsored legislation to ban U.S. embassies from flying the LGBTQ pride flag. Last year, she supported a proposal to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors; she said this month she planned to reintroduce the measure.

Greene’s Twitter restriction is not the first time she has run afoul of the site's policies. Last year, her personal account was suspended for repeatedly violating Twitter's Covid misinformation policy. Twitter also flagged a tweet on her congressional account that mocked a transgender Biden administration official, saying the post violated the company’s rules for hateful conduct.

Greene was also repeatedly suspended in 2021 for false claims about election fraud in Georgia and for her tweets about vaccines.”

At what point the government is going to be involved and shut Fux down for endangering democracy? I know all of that 1a thingy but 1a doesn't cover malicious speech and no corporation will hand in 1 billion dollars to anyone if they know they are not guilty of malicious intent they are accused of. Are the stability and profitability of a corporation more important than the peace and stability of a nation?   Here's a definition of unprotected speech by Wikipedia.

""Categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment (and therefore may be restricted) include obscenity, fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law, true threats, and commercial speech such as advertising.""

This law is still on the books and it was based on junk science.

During the 1900 - 1930 junk science was in its hay-day. There were claims that a person's intelligence could be decided by measuring their head or examining the bumps on their head. Carey Buck became a victim of this when her mother, year-old baby daughter, and herself were tested using junk science methods and deemed imbeciles.

They were not! Carey showed the same intellectual ability as a twelve-year-old which is when her schooling ended because she was removed from the school to work at home for her foster family. The law is rarely used today outside of the South because medical experts know the science behind the law is junk.

Today, junk science is again raising its head in the abortion argument and democrats need to fight back using the same tactics as republicans. Red states have passed laws that bypass medical professionals. Blue states need to write these medical professionals back into the laws.

Democratic-led states need to pass laws that allow someone who has been injured or damaged by a claim that is not supported by the medical science is entitled to recoup their loses.

We are a nation of laws, however, we are a society supported by science. A person should not face death nor economic ruin based on feelings rooted in religion.

I mentioned Carey Buck earlier because of the junk science used to take away her right to reproduction. The person who brought her case to the Supreme Court was her legal guardian. He was a preacher whose son had raped Carey Buck and the reason she had a child. This man used religion and ""science"" to manipulate the Supreme Court into doing his wishes.

Republicans are using these same tactics today to limit women's right to abortion. Democrats need to fight back using the same tactics used in the courts to write medical professionals back into the law. There are a few states were this may be possible. Washington is one of those states but surprisingly, so is Michigan. If this tactic can be employed, I believe it could be successful against some of these laws that are keeping medical professionals from saving women's lives.",rhino910

Plans underway for Biden to announce bid for second term next week | CNN Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/12thnjk/plans_underway_for_biden_to_announce_bid_for/,OneYearSteakDay,"Joe Biden has unironically been the most prolific and effective President in my lifetime.  I'm 38, I've got a lot of respect for what Bill Clinton and Barack Obama accomplished, I'm not even that sore about Poppy Bush's term in office, but Biden has easily outshone them (*at least* in terms of quantity, but I think the quality is there, too.)  
  
If we lived in a world in which ""What have you done for me lately?"" could encompass an entire Presidential term, Biden would be a shoe-in for reelection, at least in my opinion, but the American electorate has the short term memory of a hypoxic gerbil, so it'll probably be a fight, as always.  
  
Off topic, but sometimes as a liberal I can't help but feel like swing voters and conservatives have battered spouse syndrome:  
  
>*""Yes, I know that the last Republican President turned a blind eye to hundreds of thousands of Americans dying from COVID, and that the Republican President before that started an illegal war, and that Ronald Reagan sold missiles to Iran and ignored the HIV/AIDS epidemic and brought crack cocaine to America's streets and destroyed Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign, but I swear they're actually really sweet!

Stahl didn’t challenge Greene further.              

This why I haven't had respect for Stahl since she did the interview with Scott Brown. She brought out his family got food stamps when he was a kid, but now he was against public assistance. He blithely says ""It was a different time"" and Stahl sat there with that face full of stupor she tends to have and didn't say another freaking word. Didn't challenge him at all as if poverty and hunger are indeed somehow different today. From that day to now, she can have my ass to kiss.

My biggest personal concern is his policy actions on transportation. He is avidly forcing people to buy electric cars, but when the fires were big causing the electrical grid to be unreliable/flaky he called on Californians to not charge their cars. If you force people to buy electric cars, then you must have reliable electric power. One thing that should be done is to have power cables buried. Do you want people that cannot save themselves because they could not charge their cars?

Also, he is for 'reparations'. I do not believe that is a popular notion. NPR said 'Recent Polling Data Shows Why Nearly 2/3 Of Americans Oppose Cash Reparations' (All Things Considered June 18, 2021).

> But there is simply no equating a party led by Biden to today’s MAGA Republican Party. One side believes in American democracy, while the other has attacked it. One is governing from the mainstream, while the other champions extremism. One seeks to work collaboratively on the issues; the other has given way to conspiracy theorists and cranks.

In 2020, his share of the vote in each actually increased, but he lost all three. The reason? Biden won the votes of those who had chosen Jill Stein, Gary Johnson or another also-ran in 2016 by a 30-point margin.

Which states, “A judge should comply with the restrictions on acceptance of gifts and the prohibition on solicitation of gifts set forth in the Judicial Conference Gift Regulations. A judge should endeavor to prevent any member of the judge’s family residing in the household from soliciting or accepting a gift except to the extent that a judge would be permitted to do so by the Judicial Conference Gift Regulations.

Scoop: Turkey and Hungary Not Invited to Biden’s Big Democracy Summit,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/120xwed/scoop_turkey_and_hungary_not_invited_to_bidens/,GaryGaulin,"I wish the Democratic Party was in their place inviting China to the [Democracy Summit](https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy/) to give credit for having an elected president (the people mostly trust) and local level elections, not kingship or hated demagogue authoritarian ruler with no respect at all for election results. Details: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections\_in\_China

From what I learned by debating what a ""communist"" is it's normal to slowly change over generations to something that no longer resembles what the people began with. Eventually meeting the requirements of a respectable ""democracy"" and (from what I see) of the summit is how their communism went over time, or at least is still headed, even though Russia apparently always did its best to maintain a Chinese puppet government to help exploit their people and resources.

I can understand how their one party system can make it seem like an oxymoron to say China qualifies as a democracy, but with the way the Republican Party is now controlled by Fascists like it's pre-WW2 all over again only one functional party remains, anyway. And after WW2 ended Hitler's party had to be internationally outlawed. Where that part of history repeats like everything else has, the US officially becomes a one party democracy too. People who say it's impossible to still be a democracy can be given China's example.

And this in a way related news was in your article:

>**Whiskey Tango Foxtrot**  
>  
>A little bit of chicken fried. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s trip to see Russian President Vladimir Putin this week might have included some good old-fashioned American comfort food.  
>  
>Russian state media indicated bags of KFC takeout were delivered to Moscow’s Soluxe Hotel, where Xi was staying—which is odd since KFC is one of the dozens of brands that pulled out of Russia after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. (The chicken franchise sold their restaurants to a Russian company that rebranded the restaurants.) So what’s in the bags, Xi?  
>  
>https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/23/biden-democracy-summit-turkey-hungary/

From my experience in antifascist subs modern Chinese leadership is (other than mistreatment issues that could be found in the US too especially after Trump) not being protested against, even though the phrase ""authoritarian communism"" can make it seem that way by the word ""communism"" after the qualifier ""authoritarian"" that seems to no longer apply to China. 

Pro-democracy groups like seeing democracy happen. At least a ""keep up the good work"" is maybe deserved right now to China. It's possible I'm being overly optimistic, and will change my opinion according to new evidence, in case anyone has anything I need to know. I at least at this time think China (where they for sake of testing ""the west"" or something demanded to be there) could make a good argument that at least gets them invited to the next.",BlankVerse

With so much misinformation about abortion rights circulating throughout the United States, it is important to recognize and share the victories!   
   
Colorado is working hard to make abortion accessible throughout the state. Last Friday three bills were signed into legislation to protect abortion access in Colorado.   
   
1.     The first bill will shield those traveling from out of state into Colorado for abortion services from criminal charges. Right now, 37% of patients receiving abortion services in Colorado are from out of state.   
   
2.     The second bill will require large insurance companies to cover women’s preventive healthcare services, including abortion.   
   
3.     The third bill will make it illegal for any provider to say they offer abortion services if they don’t provide the services.

Three weeks after a deadly police shooting in Paterson, N.J., the state’s attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, announced on Monday that his office would take over day-to-day operations of the city’s troubled police department.

The new state oversight in New Jersey’s third-largest city comes after civil rights activists sent a letter to the U.S. Justice Department, asking federal officials to begin an investigation into “unlawful and unconstitutional conduct” within the Paterson Police Department.

The takeover is effective immediately. Beginning in May, Isa M. Abbassi, a chief with the New York Police Department who held leadership positions in the aftermath of the police killing of Eric Garner on Staten Island, will take control of the department, Mr. Platkin said.

“There is a crisis of confidence in law enforcement in this city,” Mr. Platkin said during a news conference in Paterson. “Under these circumstances, I cannot deliver on my duty to protect the people of Paterson and to keep officers safe who are sworn to protect them.”",ImaginationFree6807
