My favourite film of all time is called We All Loved Each Other So Much which is a character study of the decades after WW2 in Italy and how, after fighting alongside each other as communist partisans, a group of three friends find themselves morally and emotionally compromised in the same way Italy became by rejecting communism and embracing capitalism.

This movie is an interesting depiction of many important aspects of socialist struggle:

-The intersection between anti-colonialism and socialism. 

-The often reactionary role of religious leaders

-The danger of anti-imperialist nationalism without class consciousness

- The conflict between either prioritising ideological purity or military advantage in wartime

-The revolutionary potential of rural labourers (the entire film takes place in rural Ireland)

[Yanan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5VBKqiTTlI&pp=ygUReWFuYW4gZG9jdW1lbnRhcnk%3D) \- a short documentary about Pamela Jane Lapiz, a New People's Army martyr. Yanan is Nanay (mother) spelled backwards.

[The Earth of the Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysfvER5tabk&t=2848s) \- a film about New People's Army guerrillas, their daily life, and how they fight against environmentally-destructive projects all over the country

The Guerrilla is a Poet - a film about the founding of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its founder, Jose Maria Sison

Alma-Ata - The protagonist, a Filipino-Australian, finds herself back in the Philippines after finding out that her parents, both doctors, were killed by state-sponsored vigilantes. It explores the nature of people's war in indigenous communities.

Red Saga - A more experimental film about the Philippine revolution. By the same director as Guerrila is a Poet

Tu Pug Imatuy (The Right to Kill) - Two indigenous Lumad are captured by Filipino soldiers and forced to act as guides in finding the NPA. Based on a true story.

Looking for explicitly communist films,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12nbmgg/looking_for_explicitly_communist_films/,coconut_ghoul,"Most of these kind of films are going to come from former socialist party led countries or countries with big anti-imperialism movements. There are lots, but I'm just going to mention some off the top of my head (some might be because I've watched recently):

* A recent Indian film I watched called ""**Sardar Udham**"" that came out in 2021 is about the communist revolutionary Udham Singh, who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in 1940 for him orchestrating the 1919 massacre in Amristar. It's mainly anti-imperialist, but it's quite good for a modern film, it praises communist revolutionaries at the time and doesn't have any anti-communist bs in it. Also I'm from the UK and found it very interesting as they've tried to suppress that part of history.
* **The Wind That Shakes the Barley** is another great film someone mentioned about Irish independence but goes the extra mile to represent a socialist critique of the aftermath of the Irish civil war. This film was great for me as someone who's mum's family is Irish and my grandad's uncle was an anti-treaty fighter (suspected of assassinating Michael Collins, but I won't tell any family secrets here lol). Features one of my favourite James Connolly quotes and is incredibly relevant today as we see the many issues still affecting Ireland and NI because of anti-treaty forces losing/no socialist state after the war.

**Lots of Jean-luc Godard's maoist films from the late 60s through to 70s**. He never sold out even after that.

\- **His last film ""The Image Book"" was one of my favourites**, the ending made me sad for him but it was great. It's a reflection of the failures of film industry, who just keep repeating the same stories under capitalism and have let down a lot of the global south. It even shows western leftists who too often fail to analyse geopolitics with an anti-imperialist lens, with them often supporting US foreign policy for regime change in the middle east that drives any kind of socialist movement 10 steps back. However, it's very experimental  (which is what makes it great too), so maybe watching an earlier Godard film will get you used to his style first before watching this one. Lots of the reviews of it have no understanding of socialism or anti-imperialist history, therefore they find it confusing. But it's not confusing at all if you know even most basic anti-imperialist/socialist history over the past 100 years, even for someone not used to that experimental style.

His more maoist films are great too:

* **La Chinoise** is his most famous one (altho too often film guys watch that and declare themselves maoist cause of aesthetics without reading much theory lol). It's a great film and rare for it's kind, I personally think he has better films though. It's the film that started his shift towards more maoist films, which was what a lot of French leftist students/professors started getting into around that time. Not really a spoiler, but it has a great scene when a real life journalist who supported Algerian independence (and was punished by the French state for it) is talking to one of the main characters on the train, trying to give a reality check. He shows that the conditions in feudalist China suffering from imperialism are different to modern imperial France and can't be replicated by using completely the same methods. He also points out that Mao had the support of the masses, he was amazing at knowing how to garner the support of the peasants to work with him. But Godard clearly also has sympathy/envy towards the courage of the main characters too trying to make change, even if flawed.
* **His film reflecting on Palestine: ""Ici et Ailleurs""**. It's a tough watch (shows explicit scenes), but much needed for anti-imperialists. They originally tried to make a film about a Palestinian revolution, but the film couldn't continue as most of the people they had filmed were killed 6 months later. The film they released reflects back on that, and he critiques himself wondering if they did not take enough care to protect them a bit more as filmmakers. Like wondering if he got too caught up as a westerner safe from violence, while maybe egging on their fight too early on (he shows the Palestinians discussing they don't have enough intel on the enemy at the time). Also I enjoyed these films as someone who loves Mao, but since reading a recent book by Danhui Li and Yafeng Xia, I'm more strictly ML.
* **Come and See** I'm sure you will have heard of, that really is an essential and made me realise how much Western WW2 films actually don't depict it accurately or explicitly (esp when they just ridicule Hitler as someone ""silly"")
* **Ordinary Fascism (1965)**, USSR documentary film about the rise of fascism in Germany and WW2. It's one of the best there is I think. He narrator is witty too, but balances it perfectly to the more harrowing moments.
* ***I like most of Tarkovsky's films even if they aren't explicitly about socialism***, but they have similar themes that aren't as normal in western media as they weren't interested in funding similar films in the west as much
* **Battleship Pokemin**... banned in UK for a long time for being ""too revolutionary"" lol
* I also have a lot of socialist themed Chinese films I liked, some of their more famous directors used to be in the red guards (most of these films are made after the cultural revolution, so I'll only say if anyone is interested)

That's just some more explicitly communist films, but after that there's a lot of great films made in former socialist/socialist led countries too that aren't explicitly revolutionary but have themes that were harder to make under capitalism. ***Lenin believed art shouldn't purely be revolutionary all the time***, but for art to be more like art - when it's freed from the restrictions under capitalism (whatever is the easiest and safest for profit is funded, plus it usually has counter-revolutionary propaganda throughout it if it's anything political).",Better-Raspberry-901

I was already reduced to this through being a woman, through means like pornography, marketing and the heteronormative family structure that expects me to regularly perform unwanted sexual labor for my husband. 

But because women aren’t allowed to exist outside of catering to men, a lot of “normalization of queer women” has been reduced to “wouldn’t it be cool to have a threesome with TWO women instead of one?” or “you can WATCH women have SEX WITH EACH OTHER”. 

This insistence on bisexual women being a gift for men, and not someone who can be with men and women at different times has lead to increased sexual violence against bisexual women. Bisexual women are the most at risk for sexual violence, after trans women who are also commercialized and pornographized into only existing only for mens sexual consumption. 

Under capitalism a minority can only exist if they can prove that their existence is beneficial to the ruling class.

Material conditions are the real answer. Even some of the poorest people in the US (that I assume includes the so called “rednecks”, a slur btw), and in the imperial core in general, are the beneficiaries of monopoly capital. 

They have interests in monopolising the benefits they have to the exclusion of other groups within their country and supporting the exploitation of said groups within and beyond their country to preserve their position in the imperialist system. 

The concept of the labour aristocracy is near fundamental to understanding imperialism, if not just fundamental.

Also obviously it’s not just the poorest people at fault. It’s cathartic for the liberal petty bourgeoisie to blame all the faults of reaction on the “uneducated masses” while still happily ensuring monopoly capital keeps ticking.",GloriousBand

Cannabis in China vs DRPK,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1239cu9/cannabis_in_china_vs_drpk/,lan69,"The ban in cannabis is actually quite “recent”. 

> In 1985, the People's Republic of China joined the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and identified marijuana as a dangerous narcotic drug, and illegal to possess or use it

Remember China’s relations with US at that time was very good and the PRC was very newish member in the UN; probably didn’t think much about banning it with all the Reagan BS drug war going around.

And yes marijuana has long medicinal use prior to the ban. China is also a large producer of hemp products and also has a large number of [cannabis patents.](https://qz.com/163726/china-is-cornering-the-cannabis-patent-market)

As some people mentioned it’s also the old stigma from the opium wars about drug use. I think with everything going around now, legalizing it isn’t much of a priority right now.",Thankkratom
Cannabis in China vs DRPK,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1239cu9/cannabis_in_china_vs_drpk/,GojiraTheWuMao,"As a Chinese national, I'm going to give my 50 cents (get it?) on this topic:

There is a huge stigma against any substance that can alter your mental state, this can be something as mild as painkillers or as severe as LSD. In regards to Cannabis, the name in Chinese translates to ""大麻“ which roughly translates to, ""The Great Numbing""

There is also very low demand for Cannabis in China. According to State affiliated media, the most commonly sought over drugs are primarily Opiate derivatives (like Heroin) and Ketamine. 

To answer your question, there is a huge ""conservative stigma"" against weed, where it's medicinal values are not discussed, at least not at the family dinner table. Taking weed is looked down upon and even among druggie circles, weed does not seem to be particularly sought after.

There isn't and thus far hasn't been a Youth counter-culture where weed-taking (like the Hippies if I'm correct?) is popularized. So, there isn't much demand to legalize weed either.",Thankkratom

Cannabis in China vs DRPK,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1239cu9/cannabis_in_china_vs_drpk/,interfaith_orgy,"The first historically recorded word for cannabis, ma, is actually of Chinese origin. The plant possibly originated in China and in many regions of it has been part of the everyday pharmacopeia since antiquity. Cannabis comes up in Chinese traditional pharmacology, but one difference is that all parts of the plant have consistently been used. Still today, but in the past as well, China has highly developed domestic hemp industry. Even in the ancient period its psychoactive effects were known. Yes, the modern law is harsh, but in many areas of the country especially the rural ones, I've read that use is somewhat tolerated, but cultivation is still punished harshly. It would be hard to crack down on, anyways, considering cannabis grows on the side of the road in places like Yunnan. In some parts of that area of China, in the more mountainous areas, it is well-known among foreign backpackers that locals can be found selling little bags of the stuff if you look hard enough.


So cannabis does have a long history of established use in China, though mainly for medical reasons. There are a lot of interesting arguments from anti-drug prohibitionist Marxists generally on this. Many are somewhat convincing. Specifically for China, it is argued that the recent history of recreational drug use is deeply intertwined with the century of humiliation and what was Great Britain's policy of opium imperialism. The Japanese utilized similar tactics in that they were very light on opium during their fascist occupation. When the Communists liberated Shanghai, a quarter of the population were opium smokers. The Communists led a strong and effective anti-addiction campaign that had very positive effects on Chinese society, after the retreat of the Nationalists to Taiwan. This is an argument of historical circumstances specific to China, though.


Another common anti-drug argument I see from comrades is that every Marxist-Leninist state today pursues a policy of drug abolition, as did the Soviet Union historically. People say that, especially in imperial core countries where drug criminalization is tied to oppression of national minorities, drug legalization can play a progressive role, but that there is a reason that Marxists ban drugs once in power: lack of social necessity. This would be a line that can be critiqued, if it was consistent, which it is not. In Cuba, purchasing age for tobacco is 18. There is no smoking age. Tobacco is one of Cuba's major exports to this day. The drinking age is 16. Tobacco, if we look at sheer death toll over the course of history, both directly from cancer and also through the slavery and imperialism involved in its growth in global popularity, is the deadliest drug out there.


During the revolution and civil war, one of the lesser known goals the Bolsheviks fought for was the total abolition of alcohol. It was decried as a tool by the ruling class and tsardom to stupefy the workers and peasants. Pre-revolution, a state monopoly on vodka in particular was a key contributor to the familial wealth of the Romanovs. Several major anti-alcohol campaigns were launched, being somewhat successful, but alcohol was never abolished. As a matter of fact, instead, a state monopoly over it was established. Alcohol is a deadly and incredibly socially costly drug. It is tied to every social ill. When social cost is calculated for, some contemporary studies rank alcohol up there in terms of danger with heroin and methamphetamine.    To quote a SCMP article on alcohol use today in China, ""Women in the study drank little alcohol, but a third of men drank alcohol regularly and a quarter of these had at least one indicator of problem drinking."" Among people 15 and up in China, 25% of them smoke. Is this the ""total drug abolition"" in officially Marxist states I see anti-drug communists talking about? The holes in this non-argument go on and on and on; it's like discussing Swiss cheese. 


Considering the fact that in no socialist country has socialism managed to eradicate the material basis for substance abuse, which I think, in part, is human curiosity and urge to feel pleasure/ignore problems, progressive people should think about drug prohibition more critically. In some places where it is currently being piloted, drug decriminalization has not even produced a statistically significant increase in recreational drug use. Paired with rehabilitation programs, it can lead to a decrease even in addiction rates. If recreational drug use is regulated for, we can even avoid things like fentanyl polluting supply, which takes thousands of young lives. I am sympathetic to those that want to pursue some form of drug abolition from the left. All the current communist states banning drug use do have justifiable reasoning for their drug policy. Of course the export of tobacco by Cuba, for example, which is under a crushing genocidal embargo, in a place where managing to export anything at all is a miracle, is a net gain for society. The industry is socially necessary itself. So while I am sympathetic, it does bug me when I see comrades here gloss over these problems. Really what I feel most drug prohibition comes down to is an arbitrary decision of ""what are the good drugs and what are the bad ones,"" when I'd say there are no bad drugs. Even meth gets prescribed, it is called Desoxyn. Heroin is used in hospitals, it is just labeled diamorphine, the scientific name. No drug is just good or bad, but all can have bad uses. You can smoke as much weed as you want and be fine, but take too much acetaminophen and you will die a slow, agonizing death. I'm very open to hearing counterarguments, but in an era where psychedelics and cannabis are proven to have serious medical potential, as does MDMA, these are things worth talking about for leftists. After a revolutionary war, for example, where many would deal with deep psychological trauma and possibly develop PTSD, which MDMA is a strong, good treatment for, does MDMA become socially necessary for the workers' state to produce?",Thankkratom

An example would be Carlism or when people such as Edmund Burke talk about how they hate economics. There are also groups like the Luddites during the industrial revolution that targeted their resentment at the machines themselves rather than the mode of production.

Anti capitalist movements that weren't socialist/communist?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12f6qz2/anti_capitalist_movements_that_werent/,GenosseMarx3,"You need to make a distinction between ideology and reality here. Ideologically a group could not be socialist or communist and still be so in practice as there is no other order to replace capitalism with going forward. And they can also have some vague adherence to communism or socialism but be nothing but reformists because their conception of the order to build or the means and path to do so is so vague. 

Eduard Bernstein, who was the first to give systematic expression to the social democratic ideology, famously put it like so: The path is everything, the goal is nothing. That means nothing else than that they had become defenders of capitalism while claiming but the most vague adherence to some idea of another order. If the goal of the movement is removed you end up just reproducing the movement, that is the bourgeois order which itself produces the movement. If you follow that strain you can have a global analysis that starts from Germany and spans the globe from there.

An example where there was anti-capitalism and no socialist goal would be romantic anti-capitalism. That is the later German romantics who would advance critiques against the emerging bourgeois order but with the goal of *going back* into the feudal order, which they romanticized into a realm of heavenly order.

You also have a phenomenon like liberation theology. People inspired by Christianity to fight for communism with the idea that it is an order more in line with Christ's idea of an orderly society, that it overcomes the destruction of man by man. This was popular in the second half of the last century in South America and the Americans lead a war against it. There are now similar ideas and movements in the Philippines. And [Engels also already described](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/peasant-war-germany/index.htm) how the protestant reformer Thomas Münzer effectively stormed far ahead of the peasants war, already aiming, unconsciously, for communism.",CZiemba

You described people like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez at “grifters” because they don’t actually intend to dismantle capitalism. I agree they aren’t genuinely anti-capitalists but I’m struggling to see them as grifters (maybe they are, hard to say for sure). To me they seems like a very unsurprising product of the material conditions at play in a very right-wing country within the imperial core. Their misuse of the term “socialist” aside, they are unfortunately very in-line with the views so many radlibs, socdems, and “democratic socialists” in the core. They are ultimately arguing for a political program that yields a more even split of the imperial pie, whether they consciously understand it as such or not. As far as I can tell they really believe in their politics, rather than being straightforward grifters (again I could be wrong there). If you haven’t already read them, I highly recommend either of Zak Cope’s major books. Although they left me feeling pretty pessimistic, they really helped me understand why “leftwing” politics in the imperial core have usually been so deficient.",CZiemba

We can draw a comparison to the May '68 uprising in France, which was even larger encompassing almost ten million people. It was also yet more radical, people were occupying universities, schools, factories, the slogan of workers power arose. But there was no leadership. The French CP was revisionist and against the protests. The protests didn't make the move to attempt power seizure. And by the end of June the de Gaulle government, which was supposed to be overcome, got a majority in the national assembly. The whole uprising collapsed. There were longer consequences, of course, party building attempts that lasted another decade, but the main event was lost.

Currently there is a small Maoist party in France, they are active within the protests, as they where during the Yellow West events. But they are ideologically and organizationally not up to the task. However it seems like there won't be any end to these uprisings in the foreseeable future. Capitalism is in a structural crisis which has broken to the surface in 2008 and has not been overcome since then, with still no way out in sight other than another world war. Under these circumstances the chance for new vanguard parties to arise and give guidance to the struggles, to raise class consciousness and the level of organization are better than in 68, not just in France but globally. We need a longer term perspective this time around.

The 68 crisis was ultimately rooted within the breakdown of the Fordist accumulation model and the end of the post-war boom (which was premised on the destruction of capital during WWII). It was overcome, or rather it was pushed into out times, with the neoliberal accumulation regime, capitalism was able to adapt relatively quickly (took about a decade), meanwhile there's no such way out in sight so far.

What’s up with China and the Philippines?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12go0xt/whats_up_with_china_and_the_philippines/,sudo-bayan,"As a person from the Philippines, the question honestly because a bit old at times.

In the sense that we have battled from one form of imperialism to another in the relatively short time that we have become a nation.

If you want concrete evidences of how chinese revisionism is playing out in our land, there are projects such as kilaw dam (which granted wasn't started by chinese investment but is neither stopped by it, and whose construction would threaten indiginous communities and ecologically important zones), or how the AFP which is engaged in a war with it's own people regularly receives arms shipments from China (as well as the US).

These contradictions have necessitated the CPP to analyze and try to understand why this is so. Sison already had a relatively accessible book on the history of soviet revisionism, so it in a way it isn't hard for one to connect the dots to how china got to the position now.

This doesnt make the CPP some strange western backed terrorist group (which is honestly absurd to even say out loud but I have read dengists who actually believe this), or that because china must be good coz it is AES, that the CPP must be bad because it resists imperialist expansion (in all forms not just the Chinese) which jeopardizes china's socialism by 2040 or something strategy (which is hilarious that westerners take this at face value and not see what even the chinese claim).

I would highly advice reading and understanding smoke's response, It might be difficult at first, but the response is probably one of the best ones to try to understand why something that is intuitively grasped by people in my country (who are subject to all forms of oppression) can be so difficult to see from the perspective of those outside.",Thankkratom

They are Social Imperialist, but rather than take it as a moral claim, and be appalled by immorality of it all, we take this as simply a function of reverting to a capitalist mode of production where the state is acting in the interest of Capitalism. Even of the CPP were open to working with China (that is revert to revisionism), which group has more resources to protect the interest of Chinese capital, a severely underfunded jungle guerrilla group or a pre-existing state with all the organization of force it can already muster? It is no real mystery why China supplies arm to the fascist regime there. 

As to this sort of campist mentality, China is not worthy of support now in the same way the revisionist USSR is not worthy of support. Revisionist China and USSR foriegn policy is not dictated by any proletarian internationalism but by realpolitik. Any revolutionary movement should expect to be dropped the moment they become inconvenient. In China's case, China was mostly neutral while America engage in its various war crimes, and has only been pushed into a confrontational stance with America because of America's inability to tolerate an economic peer competitor, especially with China moving up the value chain, no matter how beneficial it has been to Capital on either side. My guess is that, if China had its way, they would continue with the starus quo ante bellum, with more or less friendly economic relations with America.",Thankkratom

It is also one of the handful of Ukrainian media that still does anything approaching meaningful journalism nowadays. This article is full of interesting details. Particularly those taking stock of the Russian Federation's semi-peripheral capitalist political economy and comprador bourgeoisie as impediments to non-military resolutions. I recommend [perusing their newsite](https://strana.today/), even using a machine translator if necessary.

There are several glaring omissions here too. There was a NATO-AFU offensive against the Donbass, Kiev regime statements regarding nuclear weapon acquisitions and a conquest of Crimea military doctrine alongside an intensified hybird war on Russia in early 2022. Additionally over 700,000 citizens of the LDNR attained Russian citizenship. The ""special military operation"" or Russian armed forces counter-offensive was not out of the blue really.

Why was East German Life Low-Quality?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12jn833/why_was_east_german_life_lowquality/,StateandRevML,"The thing about cars is that they just weren’t a priority in the USSR. I know in the US and west the car is seen as an ultimate freedom but they’re really bad for the environment and wasteful in general.

Soviet planning focused on busses, trains and other means of public transport that was more efficient and cheaper to maintain and use.

Also I think when you talk about the soviet socialist experiments now you really have to specify the period. The 70s/80s were super turbulent with governments who weren’t really into the communist thinking anymore and wanted the western opulence mixed with a good bit of corruption. A society in collapse isn’t going to have as much to go around. That’s way for example a lot of Polish people will talk about breadlines and not enough food but they forgot to mention the free fall towards capitalism that they were in. Previous to that they had plenty of food and goods to consume",ChooseOn
Why was East German Life Low-Quality?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12jn833/why_was_east_german_life_lowquality/,GenosseMarx3,"The East German new bourgeoisie started to restore capitalism in the late '50s, which fucked up planning and introduced more and more market forces and thus anarchy into production. It threw the economy into increasing chaos as the contradiction between planing and commodity production and its anarchy only increased as the restoration of capitalism unfolded. Same thing as happened in the USSR. By the '70s the situation was escalating more and more and the East German started to become increasingly indebted to West German monopoly capital, which thus gained a foothold in the country. If you speak German or want to use google translate, [this is a pretty good, fairly in-depth analysis](https://www.die-rote-front.de/sozialismus-in-den-farben-der-ddr-ueber-den-revisionismus-erich-honeckers-endversion/) (aside from the Ulbricht apologia) of how it went down.

Regarding cars: they made the mistake of introducing private cars in the first place. Private cars are one of the most environmentally destructive inventions of capitalism and, imo, no socialist country should have introduced them. Instead public transport with trams, trains, buses, boats, easily accessible bicycles and what have you should have been increasingly expanded.

Also the GDR, like any other socialist country and like most revisionist countries who don't manage to transform into social-imperialist ones, did not profit from imperialism. The high living standards we enjoy in the imperialist countries are a product of the super-exploitation our monopoly bourgeoisie foists upon the workers in the oppressed and exploited countries. It's rooted in the forced underdevelopment of the majority of the world's countries by imperialism, in what basically amounts to robbery of natural resources through unequal exchange, in the assault on any attempt to escape this shit by those oppressed countries. The contrast to the FRG (West Germany) was also somewhat artificially heightened by the US, which deliberately built up the country as a model capitalist society directly at the front lines of the Cold War, neighboring the Eastern Block.",ChooseOn

4) The FRG exploited workers en masse. Gastarbeiter wern‘t just there because of „labor shortage“ – they were a welcomed cheap resource.

People’s Army or Women’s Army? Men’s Communism and its Dissidents,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1253c1g/peoples_army_or_womens_army_mens_communism_and/,whentheseagullscry,"This had some interesting discussions of the US Left, attempting to bring together ideas from Torkil Lauesen and Butch Lee, two communists highly respected in this sub. 

The thesis is that previous socialist revolutions have failed to liberate women, due to failing to understand how class is gendered. Combined with the accusation that Stalin was a sexual predator who upheld a ""patriarchal order"", you might think this is a turn to blatant anti-communism, but avoids that by praising the Indian and Filipino revolutions for being dominated by women. Settler women are called upon to separate themselves from their nation and create their own culture and army, and to follow Blekingegade Gang's example in sending resources to revolutionary New Afrikan & Indigenous trans women formations.

There's a lot to unpack here (hopefully I don't have to respond to the ""Stalin was a sexual predator"" stuff) so I'll just point at a couple things. There's some communist basis in the idea of exploiting the gender contradiction among settlers, as MIM once argued, and there's an noble attempt to avoid the pitfalls of previous attempts at woman's separatism. What I find especially interesting is that colonized men are seen as potential comrades if they're queer, distinct from the homophobia/transphobia that was common in feminism's second wave. Outside of this subset of men, there's cynicism about men's interest in communism:

""As such gender oppressed people do not “belong” to the proletariat, but the proletariat belongs to gender oppressed people in a very literal sense, as they make up the vast majority of the proletariat and other oppressed classes. It is the relatively few proletarian men who will have to follow along, have to see their interests as inseparable from those of the gender oppressed proletariat, not the other way around.""

This is similar to Butch Lee's Night-Vision. I'm not sure how true this is, the feminization of labor has proletarianized women in droves, but is it to the point where proletarian men the minority? This is true in very significant cases such as the textile industry, but then you have migrant farmers [which still seem to be largely men.](http://www.ncfh.org/uploads/3/8/6/8/38685499/fs-migrant_demographics.pdf). The Amerikan left has had a long-standing view of the proletariat as being male-dominated, which needs to be combatted, but could this perhaps be an over-correction? This isn't just quibbling, as this understanding of the proletariat as being fundamentally feminized is key to the concept of settler women finding solidarity with the global proletariat, and what motivates Butch Lee's more controversial writings like [seemingly both-sidesing the US invasion of Iraq.](https://kersplebedeb.com/posts/wwd1-2/)

It's obvious that this article is born from womens' experiences with misogyny in the US Left, one particular example given being how ""mutual aid"" often relies on the thankless labor of women ([in fact I recently posted about how this misogyny is extremely obvious in online leftist communities](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/123tw7e/what_is_the_communist_perspective_on_the_incel/jdzx4po/)). That's not to exonerate the author but its a reminder that this is something that the US Left needs to struggle with. And despite all this I do hope the author finds their struggle among settler women productive. There's more you can talk about (the increased focus on trans women especially) but I don't want this post to get too long

Pinging /u/mushroomisst, if you have anything to add, we've talked a couple times about gender oppression, and it'd be interesting to get insight from someone else who's read Night-Vision.",whentheseagullscry

If I recall correctly about 18 years ago right before the great recession he made a video about economics and where he offhandedly mentioned that he wasn't going to buy property at that time because he thought it was over valued.
(This opinion aged like a fine wine.)

In one of his videos he mentioned Karl Marx (as a legitimate historical economist bedside Smith) where I think he said something like:

Why did socialism fared so poorly in Poland?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12rqess/why_did_socialism_fared_so_poorly_in_poland/,adorations79,"Like you said, Poland was one of the most revisionist, liberal countries in the Eastern Bloc. Combine this with the fact that Poland falling to the West would have huge geopolitical repercussions and you get a lot more instability than a typical revisionist social democratic country. 

People usually recommend to read that one book called Class Struggle in Socialist Poland but it’s analysis is inadequate as the Polish conflict is painted by the author as a conflict between two socialisms, one centralized and one decentralized. This is false because the opposition was advocating for a complete restoration of capitalism and a turn to Western Europe/US. The rhetoric of decentralized socialism was borrowed from Yugoslavia which had an even more horrid revisionism than Poland, Yugoslav rhetoric was always copied by reactionary movements in the Eastern Europe (notably Hungarian uprising of 1956 which Yugoslavia supported). The opposition had to attack the Polish status quo as centralized planning even though it was far from that.

So that book is harmful to recommend. This should be read instead:

Why did socialism fared so poorly in Poland?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12rqess/why_did_socialism_fared_so_poorly_in_poland/,YaLikeJazz505,"   Well I'm not an economist but as a pole I can tell you some of the reasons that are often pointed out.
  First, out of all of the countries in Europe, Poland arguably suffered the biggest human and material losses after WWII. Over 80% of warsaw was completely destroyed (and that includes 100% of critical infrastructure like train stations, bridges, etc) and rest of the country wasn't in much better shape so that naturally put us way behind any other european country. 
   The other thing that I hear often is that we exported a lot of our good to the USSR and received very little in return, which caused a lot of product shortages. 
   There were also just some poor decisions on the government's part. For example, in 1970's there was a new first secretary, Edward Gierek  who swore to ease the tensions between the government and citizens and modernise the country. He kind of succeed in this but he had to take a lot of loans from the west. Some of the loaned money was really well spend, as his term is often considered to be the most sucessful when it comes to living standards during PRL, but some of them were not (for example investing in outdated agricultural equipment), which made the government unable to pay back the loans and put us in big debt. 

These are most of the points that I know about, other than bullshit arguments about planned economy being inherently inefficient, but keep in mind that I know most of this stuff from school, and our education system has currently a huge right wing bias so there might be better answers to your question. 

Also, I'd just like to point out that while Polish People's Republic had a lot of issues, its not really accurate to consider it a failure at all fronts. The socialist government  did a great job at rebuilding a country completely ravaged by war and caught up with the west in a lot of key aspects, like life expectancy, which was dramatically low even before the war. Welfare and public transport system were way better compared to what we have now and a lot of people who lived in those times have really good experiences and memories.",TuT070987

We've seen previous revolutions succeed or advance this close to success without an International to aid them. One would have to actually concretely make the case for why that would be no longer possible. There are some aspects you could name: for example Pao-Yu Ching claims the neoliberal phase has basically transformed the national bourgeoisie in the oppressed countries into compradors, which would mean a substantial support for the revolution in oppressed and exploited countries has been removed. And Mao also always stressed in his writings on New Democracy how the Soviet support was crucial for the success of the Chinese revolution. And indeed we can see that the two ongoing peoples' wars are taking decades already without such support. Still, we've also seen the rapid advance of the peoples' wars in Peru and Nepal, so there's countervailing evidence, too.

I do think a new International could accelerate the ongoing revolutions and foster the spread and development of new revolutions, party building projects, and the mutual exchange of concrete analysis. But first we need a thorough reckoning with the Third International, its errors and shortcomings, why it was disbanded, how its specific form lead contributed to this or maybe even was the primary reason. If I recall correctly Stalin and Mao gave the reason for the disbanding that this specific form of the International - i.e. it being conceived of as the international communist party - was no longer adequate to the complexity of the international situation. And that's, I suspect, the case. A new International probably should not be conceptualized as an international communist party with the corollary form of organization (democratic centralism on an international scale with the respective national parties subject to the decisions of the central committee). The Chinese revolution succeeded because it ignored the orders of the International, and Stalin later admitted they were right in doing so. So we would probably need something less strict, more dynamic, but still fostering exchange and support of ideas as well as material support.

That's as much as I can speculate without concrete investigation but while at least having thought about this before.",tachibanakanade

The CPSU was already infested with revisionists long before Kruschev came to power— that’s what the Great Purges were about. You should generally reorient your understanding entirely from the above. How was it that a small cadre of Soviet communists were able to work with the masses in the construction of socialism despite the party by and large being filled with revisionist bureaucrats?

The power of capitalism as a totalizing and global institution is that it must be reckoned with even when striving toward autarky. The USSR/PRC/PRA/DDR/etc. were significant outliers to every other nation state, from economic growth to national self-determination to relations to production. 

It’s important for us to demystify this to show that revisionism is just reversion to a mean, and that the bright spots of socialist construction are what must be accounted for, not their fall which is indistinguishable from any other country in the same historical epoch and the same position within imperialism. We can move forward from these victories with new lessons only from their historic victories and defeats, but to argue they were never proletarian dictatorships just doesn’t align with history.",-thr0wawayawaw0rht-

This implies that the bourgeoisie still exists and will continue to exist until communism is achieved. To reach communism, money must be eliminated, the contradiction between manual and intellectual labor must be resolved, the law of value must be overcome, and production must be collectivized. These things have never been fully realized by socialism around the world. Only attempts have been made to proceed in that direction. What has this implied? That the bourgeoisie was there and remained. It changed form but not substance. Some will say ""the bourgeoisie was eliminated with the socialization of the means of production"". It is true that private bourgeoisie was eliminated, but bureaucratic and managerial bourgeoisie remained, meaning the bourgeoisie that prospers in corruption by extracting surplus value from companies by exploiting its position of power. This bourgeoisie must be fought with top-down maneuvers (purges) and bottom-up ones (mass mobilizations), focusing on the latter. Attacks that come especially in the workplace in order to revolutionize production relations in a socialist sense. Class struggle in socialism, as always, is the engine of history and cannot be neglected, lest stagnation occur. Therefore, an inability of the proletarian vanguard to manage the phenomenon has led to the failure of socialist experiments. We must learn from these mistakes and move forward.  
How did the new bourgeoisie take power? First of all, it must be said that this bourgeoisie has always had its representation within the Party since the time of Lenin (let us remember the Mensheviks). The Party is not a monolith as Stalin erroneously thought, but a contradiction as Mao explained to us. A contradiction between a left and right wing. Between a red and black line. Between the vanguard of the proletariat and the infiltrated bourgeoisie. Between Marxism and revisionism. A contradiction that will last forever until the definitive overthrow of the class-divided society, until communism. The solution is again given by Mao: the right must be isolated by attracting the centre, making the bourgeoisie come out into the open, and destroying it. This was done with the Hundred Flowers Campaign and the Cultural Revolution, which unfortunately failed.  
If this is not done, the bourgeoisie will hide and conspire to take power at the opportune moment. Thus, a Stalin sycophant like Khrushchev, as soon as Stalin died, rushed with his clique to repudiate Stalin, to slander him. The jackals came out into the open, showing everyone who they were, but at that point, the strength of the proletarian vanguard was too weak, and Molotov and Beria did not have time to stop the counter-revolutionary wave that Stalin already felt coming but could not stop in time. The bourgeoisie had consolidated its power over the years because production relations were not continually revolutionized, and so now it was taking back power and propagating revisionism as a bourgeois ideology disguised as Marxist to confuse the masses and take total control of the party. Thus, social imperialism was established, and small socialist countries, suffering the same fate, became satellite countries, almost semi-colonial.",-thr0wawayawaw0rht-

To me, the Soviet Union did manage to be a dictatorship of the proletariat at the beginning of its existence. However, the old Russian Empire's economic system made that there were very few actual workers. The industrial proletariat was not developed at all. That's why, of course, Lenin defended the idea of a vanguard party to realize the material conditions of the transition to socialism with a large industrialized proletariat. However, this only work is the Communist Party is indeed a party of and by the proletariat. 

In the beginning of the revolution, workers self-organized within the Soviets and from there exerted actual dictatorship of the proletariat. The bolchevik revolution strengthened that with the removal of the bourgeois government and the establishement of a worker's party at the head of Russia. However, one major tipping point happened: the Civil War. The Civil War had three main consequences:

\- First, it destroyed most of Russia's industrial capacities and on the 3 million industrial workers that were in Russia before the war remained only 1 million at the end, because there were just no more factories or standing economy.

\- Second, as the White Armies conducted purges and slaughters whenever they got into control of a territory, targeting communists and the opposition, it meant the bolcheviks were not able to fully rely on local communist forces when they retook said territory. This led to the bolchevik government partially relying on the old administration, that was under the Tzar, as they were unable to use local forces that were purged.

\- Third, it militarized the party and reduced internal democracy. The point of democratic centralism is, of course, to allow for maximum efficiency all while retaining maximum democracy. This, however, did not survive the Civil War as War Communism was put into place. With growing militarization of the party and the extension of powers of the Tcheka, repression of other revolutionary groups that were allies before (like left SRs or anarchists in Moscow), democracy within the party was reduced.

Less democratic governance, less workers and more bureaucrats also meant that the proletarian composition of the party would also suffer from it. By the very beginning of the 1920s, the group called the Worker's Opposition, that was in favour of strengthening democracy within the party and strengthening the role of Trade-Unions in the economy, decried what they perceived as a shift: with almost no more workers within the party (don't remember the exact number they mentionned) they said the dictatorship of the proletariat was turning into a dictatorship of the party.

And as time went, bureaucracy within the party continued to grow. The Left Opposition and the Democratic Centralism group both advocated until their very end around 1927 for a return to full democracy within the party but they were purged as the bureaucratization of the party was already far too advanced. Stalin's rise to power, through these bureaucratic manipulations, marked the victory of the bureaucratic apparatus of state on the proletarian revolution. That's how I see it and how also I think trotskyist and maybe some left-communists sees it. To stalinists, maoists and some marxist-leninists, on the contrary, Stalin would have been one of the remaining actual communist in power before his death, delayed the rise to power of the bureaucracy until his death. This does not seem very logical to me. Even if he was actually a communist fighting for worker's powers, hadn't his interests aligned with the party bureaucracy, he would have been removed far earlier. And on the contrary, he purged the party's right and left wing (despite the objective of democratic centralism), thus stopping party's democracy and enshrining bureaucratic functioning. And his politics, in the end, did not align with any worker's interests. Criticized by Lenin for his russian nationalist policies, he was aligned with the NEP and criticized Preobrazhensky's proposal for collectivization of the economy. And when he did change and supported collectivization, he forgot all the economist's recommendations of no repression against the peasantry, which would reduce efficiency and alienate them the peasantry. And indeed, Stalin's ""collectivization"" policies caused disorganization and war far too state led instead of workers self-management. That's at least how I see it.

For other countries, the problem is that this authoritarian model of party was adopted by the CCP and because of economic conditions of China, of course, there were very few workers. The process of land redistribution to the peasantry by the CCP was a fair point but because of the over-militarization of the party (which could be countered with sufficient policies but did not because of non-democratic structures) in the end the bureaucracy as much if not far faster than in the Soviet Union. The difference might have been that instead of a strong and bureaucratic center, the right-wing of the party grew far more quickly which cleared the path for the contestation even of the more moderate bureaucratic representative, Mao himself. Thus explaining the power struggle between him and the right wing of the party. Paradoxically, the cultural revolution actually strengthened the crippled left-wing of the party with more workers based candidates like Wang Hongwen which led the 1967 Shangaï Commune. But that never lasted and it was from a bureaucratic apparatus anyway.

A dictatorship of the proletariat, fundamentally, requires a proletariat organized as a proletarian democracy, through soviets handing the economy and the society and through a party that they compose and control fully to lead the state and remove the old economic and bourgeois structures of power. As such, the material conditions for a dictatorship of the proletariat were not favorable at all in both Russia and China. The idea of the vanguard party fell to bureaucracy and over-militarization which in the end did not allow for the creation of democratic proletarian organizations.",-thr0wawayawaw0rht-

Most people will probably start with some stuff about the Civil War and how Taiwan is now the Republic of China because the corrupt KMT government was hated by everyone on the mainland, but also not really the Republic of China since no one, including the United States recognizes it as a real nation as a price for doing business with China.

The tension is not this decades old feud but of more recent vintage. America, seeing the rise of China and its rise along the value chain, saw the need to nip this potential peer competitor in the bud, so they frantically search for potential pain points like they did with Russia and Ukraine. Hence the ""pivot to Asia"" and why there was a flurry of attempts to prod China at where they hope it hurts most, from Xinjiang to Hong Kong to Tibet and now to Taiwan. This is compounded by the fact that Taiwan is also the place where most of the workd outsource its high end chips manufacture, an area China isn't quite at yet, meaning it is also an important node for high end tech stuff. There is therefore a double move by America, to leverage Taiwan in the way it seems it cannot do as well with Xinjiang and Hong Kong in its attempt to apply pressure on China, and its attempt to move high end chip manufacturing from Taiwan to America to protect its supply chain.

Don't be fooled by people trying to throw dust in your eyes and claim this is an ideological conflict of Democracy versus Oriental Despotism, or that the Taiwanese and Chinese are at it because of supposed Chinese Communist pompensity to aggression, it ultimately is just about the money",bttrfly99

What is the solution to settler colonialism?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12hiyzr/what_is_the_solution_to_settler_colonialism/,Left_Yoga_Spinor,"The narrative of the zionists and settler apologists is a self projection of what they did to the indigenous, “we kicked them off so they are gonna kick us off” or in the words of Thomas Jefferson, “if we don’t enslave them they will enslave us.” Justice is not an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth, it is an end to suffering and exploitation. If you stole the land yourself, you must give the land back, if you kicked them out of their home, you must be kicked off your home because it’s their home and they are still living victims, and you are a living oppressor/criminal. However, if you are not an active settler and only a descendant of settlers than it’s not your fault but it is definitely your responsibility to repair the damages of your ancestors and advocate for reparations (money compensation, victim’s descendants right to return to the township of the victim’s origin, restoration of treaties, self determination for Gaza and West Bank, return of all stolen land pre 1948 under the unified state of Palestine with equal rights for all living on the land, etc.) Decolonization is not unreasonable, it is in fact compassionate to its core! The narrative of “reverse racism” and “reverse colonialism” is meant to put fear in activists to halt justice. Let us not fall for Strawmen set up by the enemy! We are above that!",newplantdaddy90
What is the solution to settler colonialism?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12hiyzr/what_is_the_solution_to_settler_colonialism/,CommunalFarmer,"First of all, literally no one is saying “deport all white people”, that’s just a basic misunderstanding of what the term “Land Back” means. 

One of the current leading ideas in Palestine about how to deal with the issue of settler colonialism is termed “One Democratic State” (or ODS). The settler colonial governments of the are *national governments for the colonizer nation*. So one main goal is just to overthrow these governments and to establish one which at a minimum is designed as a government to actually represent all of the oppressed nations contained within. This includes establish regional governments for each nation so that they have representation missing in colonial governments. This doesn’t mean that for example in Israel, that all Jews will be forced from the country and repressed. It just means that at a minimum the violence against and repression of Palestinians will be ceased and made illegal. 

I’ll talk more at length about the US because I’m more familiar with the issues there. 

Similarly in the US, decolonization doesn’t mean “kicking all the white people out of the US” (though many would certainly flee this process, as they are actively participating in/abetting/profiting off of the oppression that is the target of decolonization). On the other hand, it does mean national independence for the remaining indigenous nations, for new africans, for chicanos and other latino nationals in the US, and the right to self-determination established on principle for all of them. It also means major land reforms, since the vast majority of land is owned by a minority of white settlers while the majority of people who actually work the land are chicanos, latin americans, or new africans. 

The thing to remember is that decolonization is still class struggle. Since colonization creates a class society based on nationality, the class struggle in such societies also takes on a national character. There’s a lot of concrete policies out there if you look, what I have rendered here is just a very basic outline.",newplantdaddy90

Don’t really have any book recommendations about it but with the opioid crisis there was a massive amount of evidence of wrongdoing by the drug companies giving lavish gifts and vacations to their doctors

Rapid increase in anti depressants sale.,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12enwti/rapid_increase_in_anti_depressants_sale/,WorkingClassAdvocate,"It's a little bit of everything. In a capitalist society where the majority of people are alienated in various ways, many people go to the doctors for depression treatments.

After over-prescribing opioid drugs, they're now trying to overcompensate and as a result people in chronic pain have a hard time getting opioid medication that would be most effective.

So while anti-depressants and anti-psychotics have always been prescribed a lot in our society, now many people who would otherwise be prescribed some kind of narcotic drugs are getting these drugs instead, one example of an anti-psychotic that's become very popular to prescribe regardless of a person's condition is Seroquel (Quetiapine). 

For example, when I went to the psych ward, they put almost everyone on quetiapine. The doctors see it as a ""mood stabilizer"" but it also makes you really drowsy and groggy in the morning (double edged sword because if you have insomnia it will help you sleep but it's very hard to get up the next day).

In our system where money is power and science itself can be corrupted with private funding, there are many studies funded to justify these prescriptions so medical professionals have that plausible deniability to say they're trying to help people as best they can. 

But the minute you look into the history of psychiatry, institutionalization, and behaviorism (particularly MK Ultra), it becomes apparent that our system is moreso designed to get suffering people out of sight and out of mind.

Antidepressants and many psychoactive pharmaceuticals are mostly used as a cudgel for our system to force people to continue to accept this grim reality. Little effort goes into actually figuring out why a person is depressed and addressing it at the root cause because we know it usually goes back to alienation or some kind of socio-economic oppression that our system is not interested in fixing.

That's why the social model of health/medicine/addiction is gaining more ground lately; as material conditions worsen, even the narcotic substances aren't cutting it anymore for a significant amount of people. 

I think that's why it's taking so long to legalize cannabis nationwide, it's probably one of the last resorts for quelling dissent and revolt, so ideally the ruling class would like to keep that in their back pocket for as long as possible, only deploying it at their most desperate hour, after they've already dominated the emerging market and made sure they'll be the ones making the profit.",Puzzleheaded_Lack516

In industrial capitalism, the workers become more and more conscious that they exist as a class, they work with tools they do not own, that they usually cannot ever hope to own, they function as one cog in the factory machine, and therefore become aware that their interest is a collective interest, that they exist as a class, hence they can aspire to what Lenin called ""Trade Union Consiciousness"".

They were mostly neutral during the Iran-Iraq war too. Before the IR, the only three encounters the Soviet Union had with Iran was right after WW1 when Reza Pahlavi declared the [Russo-Persian treaty of friendship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Persian_Treaty_of_Friendship_(1921)) with the Soviet Union, during WW2 when Britain and the Soviet Union collectively launched an invasion of Iran to sack Reza Pahlavi in the [Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran), and right after WW2 in the [Iran crisis of 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_crisis_of_1946) where Stalin refused to hand back several Soviet-occupied territories from the prior Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi basically then fought a war with the Allies on their side to regain the ethnically autonomous Soviet-aligned governments of Azerbaijan and Mahabad.

How did the KGB view the Islamic Regime of Iran?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/124w06z/how_did_the_kgb_view_the_islamic_regime_of_iran/,smokeuptheweed9,"I read this recently, hoping to find something interesting

""The Soviet Union and the Iranian Revolution"" DMITRY ASINOVSKY, 2018

All I could find was that while the Soviet Union under Stalin didn't care all that much about Iran, it became an important weapon of Khrushchev

>Dr. Mossadegh was by no means regarded in the Soviet Union as a friendly figure or as a potential ideological ally. His role in preventing the Soviet Union from obtaining oil concessions in northern Iran in 1944 and his “nationalist bourgeois program” in general played a considerable role in the Soviet foreign policy elite’s rather negative view of the Iranian prime minister. Even his nationalization program, which by all odds should have attracted the Soviet leaders as an element of the anti-imperialist struggle with Britain, was interpreted not as a step taken for the sake of the country’s national interests, but as part of Mossadegh’s deal with the U.S., a country that many hoped would take Britain’s place in Iran. Overall, the Soviet Union’s attitude to Mossadegh’s Iran was neutral.

Though in practice the USSR was ""neutral,"" and there was probably more ideological discussion within the USSR than what is portrayed here, the importance is that this supposed negativity was used by Khrushchev

>Once a potential ally of U.S. imperialists, Mossadegh started to be seen as a symbol of struggle for national liberation against crafty imperialist powers...

>In the second half of the 1950, the Soviet leadership and Nikita Khrushchev himself made several attempts to establish relations with Mohammad Reza Shah. In 1956 the Shah of Iran made his first historical visit to the Soviet Union, a mere four months after Khrushchev’s secret report to the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party. This search for compromises and neighborly relations with Iran are unequivocally attributed to the creation of the Baghdad Pact, in which Iran assumed the key role.

>Oddly enough, these attempts to find a common language with the Shah proceeded in parallel with the ideological rehabilitation of his arch political rival Mossadegh. The decision to refrain from supporting Mossadegh during the coup was among the charges put forward against Vyacheslav Molotov at the plenary meeting of the Communist Party’s Central Committee of 1957, which exposed what was described as an “anti-party group.” Molotov, who regained control of foreign policy after Stalin’s death, shared Stalin’s opinion that the revolutionary situation in Iran was hopeless. However, by 1957 the situation had changed and the refusal to support Mossadegh was interpreted as an incriminating act and betrayal of the interests of the global anti-colonial movement.

Ultimately, this concept of progressive bourgeois nationalism didn't really change since it was foundational to the ideology of the Soviet Union.

>As events in Iran followed their course in the 1970s-1980s, the Soviet Union’s attitude to the revolution and the new Iranian regime changed. Concern and skepticism about the possibility of changes in the first half of 1978 gave way in the fall and winter of 1978 to the fear that the U.S. might decide to intervene to prevent the collapse of the Iranian monarchy. Whereas these fears persisted and played a decisive role for quite some time, in early 1979 it seemed that the revolution (which looked like an accomplished fact) caused the Soviet leaders and experts to hope that left-wing forces, above all the Tudeh Party, would soon intercept the initiative. Although nothing of the sort happened, the Soviet Union continued to provide support for the revolutionary regime in Iran, even after the beginning of the operation in Afghanistan, which caused an upsurge in anti-Soviet sentiment in the Iranian leadership and society. Only the total defeat of Iran’s left-wing movement and the trial of the Tudeh Party caused a cooling and eventual freeze in Soviet-Iranian relations. At the same time, in academic circles and among experts, the revolution in Iran and the regime that took shape continued to be regarded in rather positive terms even after 1983-1984.

That is, breaking off relations was the initiative of Iran, who could basically do whatever they wanted and count on Soviet support as long as the worse option of American support existed. ""Islamic ideology"" never really entered the picture.

>Among Soviet experts there were enough people who said it was a great problem that Islam was still poorly studied as a political force and pointed to the revolution in Iran as clear proof running counter to the Soviet Union’s official public stance, which reflected the point of view of the CPSU Central Committee’s International Department (RGANI, n.d.; ARAN, n.d.)...

>However, these opinions were barely heard by the people responsible for making decisions. Against the backdrop of the Afghan events and the internal political crisis into which the Soviet Union was sliding, the Iranian problem and with it the problem of studying political Islam in fact had disappeared from the current Soviet foreign policy agenda. When Anatoly Dobrynbin told the conference at Lysebu that there had been no debate inside the Soviet leadership over Islamic fundamentalism and that this term did not exist as such, he was speaking the truth.

To be fair, I also don't care about ""Islamic ideology."" The difference is I do not accept ""geopolitics"" as the determinant force of history but rather class struggle. Overall, it wasn't that interesting historically and the question of Afghanistan was far more important both for the USSR and for thinking about political Islam as a historical ideology. Even the ruling class of Iran was unclear about their own ideology, given they broke off relations with the USSR over Afghanistan even though the mujahedeen would become their main ideological enemy.

Venezuela project,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12dptxb/venezuela_project/,LordJike,"As someone who had lived in venezuela for most of their entire childhood and into adulthood, I can assure you that if the objective of the PSUV (Partido Socialista Unido de Veneuzela, the current ruling party) was to turn Venezuela into a socialist state, they have failed miserably.

Venezuela has always had a crippling overreliance on oil to get it's economy running, and while it did have a couple other industries (like metallurgy in bolivar), they for the most part took a bit of a backseat compared to oil.

To make things worse, any income generated from this oil (even after the leases for the oil fields ended and their control was trasferred to national companies) was never put into improving the industrial capacity of Venezuela and instead it was all driven into the tertiary sector.

The result of this was what I'd like to call ""parallel worlds"", of which on one side you had an extremely poor population that barely got anything from the spoils of oil extraction, and on the other side you had a rich population tied to the major industries of Venezuela (especially oil) of which even the least monetarily endowed were capable of living it out with a quality of life comparable to in a western country.

When the PSUV came to power (by electoral means), they also gained control of the country's oil reserves, and when they did so, they continued to make the same mistakes Venezuela had been doing with it's oil money, focusing on building welfare programs rather than investing into improving Venezuela's productive capabilities. The oil money went from providing services to the rich to providing services for the poor.

This ""Parallel World"" I mentioned never went away anyways, it merely shifted a bit. The expropiations caused some of the rich to flee the country, but plenty of disgustingly rich people remain to this day, and plenty more joined them as government corruption was never solved, and you could get substantial amounts of money by having connections to government officials or merely being a state worker (when my family left the country for spain we basically got to expedite all the paperwork to get out by paying off government officials.)

To top it off, with the sanctions and all the oil industry in Venezuela never grew since the PSUV took control of the country, and plenty of other industries have shut down.

I argue that Venezuela is a country that is being kicked down for being ""socialist"" while only half-assedly trying to be it.",Automatic-Pension-10

Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.

I listened to all that was said in this court in support and justification of this prosecution, but my mind remains unchanged. I look upon the Espionage Law as a despotic enactment in flagrant conflict with democratic principles and with the spirit of free institutions…

Your Honor, I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the social system in which we live; that I believe in a fundamental change—but if possible by peaceable and orderly means…

Standing here this morning, I recall my boyhood. At fourteen I went to work in a railroad shop; at sixteen I was firing a freight engine on a railroad. I remember all the hardships and privations of that earlier day, and from that time until now my heart has been with the working class. I could have been in Congress long ago. I have preferred to go to prison…

I am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and the factories; of the men in the mines and on the railroads. I am thinking of the women who for a paltry wage are compelled to work out their barren lives; of the little children who in this system are robbed of their childhood and in their tender years are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the monster machines while they themselves are being starved and stunted, body and soul. I see them dwarfed and diseased and their little lives broken and blasted because in this high noon of Christian civilization money is still so much more important than the flesh and blood of childhood. In very truth gold is god today and rules with pitiless sway in the affairs of men.

In this country—the most favored beneath the bending skies—we have vast areas of the richest and most fertile soil, material resources in inexhaustible abundance, the most marvelous productive machinery on earth, and millions of eager workers ready to apply their labor to that machinery to produce in abundance for every man, woman, and child—and if there are still vast numbers of our people who are the victims of poverty and whose lives are an unceasing struggle all the way from youth to old age, until at last death comes to their rescue and lulls these hapless victims to dreamless sleep, it is not the fault of the Almighty: it cannot be charged to nature, but it is due entirely to the outgrown social system in which we live that ought to be abolished not only in the interest of the toiling masses but in the higher interest of all humanity…

I believe, Your Honor, in common with all Socialists, that this nation ought to own and control its own industries. I believe, as all Socialists do, that all things that are jointly needed and used ought to be jointly owned—that industry, the basis of our social life, instead of being the private property of a few and operated for their enrichment, ought to be the common property of all, democratically administered in the interest of all…

I am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions of men and women who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough for a wretched existence.

This order of things cannot always endure. I have registered my protest against it. I recognize the feebleness of my effort, but, fortunately, I am not alone. There are multiplied thousands of others who, like myself, have come to realize that before we may truly enjoy the blessings of civilized life, we must reorganize society upon a mutual and cooperative basis; and to this end we have organized a great economic and political movement that spreads over the face of all the earth.

There are today upwards of sixty millions of Socialists, loyal, devoted adherents to this cause, regardless of nationality, race, creed, color, or sex. They are all making common cause. They are spreading with tireless energy the propaganda of the new social order. They are waiting, watching, and working hopefully through all the hours of the day and the night. They are still in a minority. But they have learned how to be patient and to bide their time. The feel—they know, indeed—that the time is coming, in spite of all opposition, all persecution, when this emancipating gospel will spread among all the peoples, and when this minority will become the triumphant majority and, sweeping into power, inaugurate the greatest social and economic change in history.

In that day we shall have the universal commonwealth—the harmonious cooperation of every nation with every other nation on earth…

Your Honor, I ask no mercy and I plead for no immunity. I realize that finally the right must prevail. I never so clearly comprehended as now the great struggle between the powers of greed and exploitation on the one hand and upon the other the rising hosts of industrial freedom and social justice.

I can see the dawn of the better day for humanity. The people are awakening. In due time they will and must come to their own.

When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his weary watch, he turns his eyes toward the southern cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight approaches, the southern cross begins to bend, the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of time upon the dial of the universe, and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the lookout knows that the midnight is passing and that relief and rest are close at hand. Let the people everywhere take heart of hope, for the cross is bending, the midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning.

'The Communist Necessity' and Combating Movementism in the Centres of Capitalism?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12iftpn/the_communist_necessity_and_combating_movementism/,GenosseMarx3,"The situation in Germany isn't that different. I guess one main difference is that those intellectuals who are interested in socialism or communism are not so much geared towards doing, rather they are all about thinking. In this way German culture stays true to itself even after Americanization. And apropos Americanization, you also see, besides the still lingering influence of the Frankfurt School, a bunch of confused intellectuals influenced by French theory by way of its Americanization, which makes it more exciting to these geniuses than if it just came straight from the French '70s, I suppose. We also have stupid shit like dance demonstrations. And, luckily, the Greens who originally emerged from the radical left side of the '68 movement, are totally exposing themselves as the most war hungry party in Bundestag (German parliament).

But there's also groups trying to reconstitute the vanguard party here. These are all small and currently in crisis due to the Ukraine War which brought light hidden contradictions in political line, i.e. the revisionist line exposed itself. I gave a bit more of [a  description of the situation here](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/114e2du/biweekly_discussion_thread_17_february/jahthvg/?context=3). More likely than not there are similar groups and attempts in the Netherlands you just don't know about. Look around a bit in your area or online, you'll probably find something.

Btw, JMP is not hinting towards purely subjective reasons but towards imperialism, the still massive social benefits it grants the workers in our parasitic countries, the problem of the labor aristocracy this creates, the way this fortifies bourgeois hegemony for quite material reasons. The phenomenon you described are derived from this social basis. If you read his new book on economism ([Politics in Command](https://foreignlanguages.press/new-roads/politics-in-command-a-taxonomy-of-economism-j-moufawad-paul/), it's good), he stresses this again and again at length as fundamental. This book also gives some ideas on how one could accumulate the most politically advanced part of our class.

In general, I think Lenin's idea of locating the lowest layer of the working class, organizing it as the hard core of the revolutionary project in the imperialist countries which must have hegemony over the other layers of the class and other classes we can accumulate once we've managed the organization of the core force. The difficult part to which there is no abstract answer lies in locating this layer of the working class, that can only be done through social investigation and a scientific analysis of the class structure of our respective societies. Again, the newer JMP book gives some pointers, but these are necessarily abstract and are more of a positive side to its general critique of old ways of going about it. I also wrote about my thought about this a bunch of times before, [here's one comment which leads to others](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/vxrvpu/what_is_to_be_done/ifymlnb/), and the other day [I tried to produce some encouragement](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/11ouffj/some_words_of_encouragement_for_younger_and/).",Prior-Jackfruit-5899
'The Communist Necessity' and Combating Movementism in the Centres of Capitalism?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12iftpn/the_communist_necessity_and_combating_movementism/,turbovacuumcleaner,"I know this isn't the kind of answer you're expecting, but perhaps a Third World contribution may be useful.

I haven't read JMP, and although he isn't discussing the Third World, what he's describing is pretty much the same here. The only differences is that no one here supports NATO, aside from fascists; and totalitarianism fell out of fashion by the mid 2010s.

Still, the rest is almost identical. The most serious similarity is that no party and organization, from PCB to AND, recognize the labor aristocracy. As to why that is, the petty bourgeoisie and [national aristocracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/11gv223/biweekly_discussion_thread_03_march/jats704/) have a dubious relationship with imperialism, and the only way they can seem revolutionary while not tackling class struggle until its last consequences is by not recognizing that the labor aristocracy exists. This is also the root of the Neokautskyite trends of multipolarity that Brazil is often associated with. Criticism of NATO, which is mostly associated with US domination, ends up empty and contradictory because of this, and this poor understanding has serious consequences, like [supporting french imperialism and the EU](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrasildoB/comments/12h20g1/inusitado_kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk/).

The impoverishment of the two aforementioned classes split them, with parts becoming the basis for Bolsonarist fascism, and other parts approaching communism opportunistically to forge an alliance with the proletariat and peasantry, in order to reindustrialize and restore the country's former position in imperialism. Still, any further revolutionary development is often met with skepticism and/or disdain, and the ensuing result is tailism (most organizations are just shittier NGOs). The cases of social-fascism that occasionally happen here are the rule, not the exception, and are consequences of these two classes' leadership.

As to how this is being tackled... It isn't. At least by any major organizations. Maoism sometimes is successful in drawing the attention of the most advanced elements of the working classes, but similar to what was mentioned about Germany, currently most discussions end up thinking Brazilian agriculture is still in the 1920s, ignore the quantitative changes of the country's classes (PT's ideological strength and size should actually be seen as the main evidence for this) and have a poor, or don't have at all, explanation for Brazilian foreign policy.

How do we reconcile this military capacity, this strength of hidden support, with the instability that has touched even leading cadres? It is well-known that the Brigades have been undergoing a protracted inner struggle over political perspective. The dominant tendency has been to try and match the imperialists blow-for-blow, to step up the level of guerrilla actions as repression intensifies. This is certainly understandable; it needs little explanation.

> The opposing point of view has been held by many leading BR cadre, particularly those in prison. In their 1980 document a discussion on subjectivism and militarism, Renato Curcio, Alberto Franceschini, and other cadre sharply criticize “military subjectivism” which has led to a one-sided concentration on tactical technique at the expense of strategic revolutionary politics. Thus, in their view, guerrilla P.O.W.s “turn” because the organization now produces fighters who are not and in some cases are unfit to be politically armed. Straining to overcome the repression on a purely military plane, the organization in the field has increasingly been concentrating everything on tactical military operations.

It does not promote ideological fascism, etc., but the great advantage to the imperialists is that this nascent neo-fascism mobilizes the masses and places them at the service of the State apparatus, permits one-party rule, suppresses the sectors of rebellion, disciplines the proletariat – and the flexibility and co-optive framework of bourgeois democracy are still retained to a large degree. Further, all these crimes are done in the name of “democracy” by a party that calls itself “Communist.” How better?

>...  
>  
>The massive network of PCI unions, student organizations, neighbourhood sections, etc. has been turned into both an informer’s network for the police and an anti-left thug army. After BR actions the PCI union officers are supposed to check if any workers in their departments missed work those days, and thus could be suspects. In some cities PCI members have been given lists of suspicious signs to watch out for in their neighbors – such as keeping irregular hours – that might indicate underground revolutionaries. AO leader Piperno was arrested in Paris because a vacationing PCI member spotted him in a cafe and called in French police. Factory rallies and strikes by the revolutionary left no longer take place, in part because the PCI has physically crushed such attempts with goon squads of hundreds of PCI security men swinging crow bars and pipes. The police and bosses assist quite happily, of course. Why would the imperialists need a fascist coup, with this type of neo-fascism (which calls itself “Communist”) to give them a mass base?

Anti-revisionists are often derided by revisionists for being sectarian, uncompromising and dogmatic, yet it's clear that this type of collaboration - which has countless examples in the late 20th century - if not a conspiracy of ""division"" by the ruling class, must be the logical outcome of a deeper material division/stratification of the working class.

The bottom line of the AUKUS deal is that it locks us into the US military strategy even further, to the point where if the US again does something stupid, such as to support Taiwan in a military confrontation with China, it would be likely that we would join with the US, thereby exposing Australia to the risk of some sort of revenge or no-regrets attack from China. Where’s our sovereignty in all that?

Surely it should be an early priority of the government to state publicly that if the US engages in a war with China over Taiwan, we will not join them. On the ABC’s Insiders last Sunday, Defence Minister Richard Marles said there had been no commitment given to joining such a war, but the government must definitively rule out any prospect of this. Yes, doing so might put the AUKUS deal at risk, but if we objectively consider the full price we are expected to pay in dollars and in subservience to the US, this is surely a risk worth taking.

Doesn’t it strike people as odd that with all the ground we are expected to give for AUKUS, we didn’t even get a binding security treaty, just loose “understandings”?

To consider the detail of the AUKUS deal, from the little we actually know at this stage, we need to begin with the recognition that its origin was basically yet another political stunt by Scott Morrison. He made the decision with about as much forethought and evidence as his delusional secret appointments of himself to multiple ministries. With an eye to the coming election, his aim was to wedge the Albanese opposition on national security and propagate the drum-beating instincts of Peter Dutton and himself.

As it turned out, this was another example of a dumb Morrison political strategy. It backfired on both fronts. The Albanese government has effectively reversed the wedge by giving Morrison and the Coalition “credit” for the initiative, and therefore for its longer-term consequences. An important question is, assuming a genuine threat, will the Chinese really be deterred by our nuclear-powered submarine capability?

What seems to grate most with defence experts is that the deal was politically driven, with no proper top-down analysis of our defence requirements leading to consideration of the most cost-effective way to achieve those requirements with maximum effect. Morrison has boasted that he didn’t properly involve his departments and that the deal was the best-kept secret in our history since World War II. He got so excited he started talking about 007.

Former prime minister Paul Keating correctly stepped beyond party discipline to seek to ask the relevant questions and to comment on the appalling media agendas being run by some on this issue. He was mostly attacked by those journalists, who let their egos and agendas outweigh what should have been their concern for the substantive issues involved in such a massive and expensive reset of our national defence strategy.

The worst of these was the warmongering agenda being run by Nine media, basically in support of the Dutton opposition. Their contrived series on the “Red Alert” of Chinese invasion was little more than a scare campaign. It was grossly irresponsible journalism. The papers’ international editor, Peter Hartcher, sounding particularly stung by the criticism, has attempted to muddy the issue. He suggests his motive has been on the high ground, to try to stimulate public discourse on the issue.

Really?

I would class Keating’s recent National Press Club appearance as vintage Keating, but turned against his party. As I have said on many occasions: it should never be Labor or Liberal, right or wrong, but it should always be Australia first.

I was particularly surprised by the widespread media criticism of Keating’s remarks, with some pundits even suggesting that he had lost it, or was becoming senile, or was just craving relevance. This struck me as unusual because he had always been the darling of the press gallery. He could do no wrong and was widely lauded for the vindictiveness of his characterisations of individuals such as me. I always found it hard to get a favourable or objective run for anything I did or said. Yet the press has become oh so prudish when they are the subject of his very personal and derogatory invective. It’s not as if they didn’t deserve it.

Not to detract from the substance of his remarks on AUKUS, Keating did go too far with his criticisms of Foreign Minister Penny Wong. She inherited an almost impossible task in repairing our relations with our Pacific neighbours, given the damage done by the former prime minister Scott Morrison.

I must say, I have been fascinated by the global focus on “the rise of China” rather than the more relevant development, namely the demise in the substance and global standing of the US. Given the speed with which China has become the world’s largest economy – and in so doing has raised many millions out of poverty – the country should be given the global respect that this deserves, especially with countries searching for ways in which they can develop productive economic, cultural and environmental relationships with the Chinese. Yet this is not the focus of the coverage.

Another area of substantial criticism of the AUKUS deal has been best summarised by Robert Hill, a Defence minister in the Howard government and a former United Nations representative. Hill contests the merit of our commitment in relation to our foreshadowed investment in the development of a new British submarine, saying in a commentary published this month by consulting service Dragoman that “it is disappointing that we invest so little in Australian indigenous Defence capability. Most major nations invest in their own industry so that industry can significantly contribute to their own economy and security”.

This type of criticism obviously hurt the government, given the amount of time it devoted in question time this week trying to claim enormous benefits in terms of jobs, new skills and technology transfers that will flow from the deal. Hill’s position was best summarised as “too many eggs in one basket”. Some have said Defence policy has become our Industry policy. The industrial benefits of the original French subs deal were ruthlessly exaggerated by the Coalition in the hope of winning or retaining seats in South Australia. Do I hear echoes?

In short, is it wise to unnecessarily antagonise our largest trading partner by sucking up further to the US, committing ourselves to further doing their bidding? Especially when so much will happen geopolitically and in submarine and associated technologies during the next three decades, creating genuine doubt about the usefulness of an AUKUS-type deal.

"On the Dissolution of ""Red Fightback""",https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/121r9jl/on_the_dissolution_of_red_fightback/,red_star_erika,"this just seems like an excuse for politsturm to try to go after Maoism again.

>But RFB reveals a fundamental 'Maoist' error in its conclusions; it believes that in the imperialist countries the labour aristocracy, petite bourgeoisie (both bribed by super-profits) and the bourgeoisie form a unified and implacable alliance against the revolution

>Yet RFB explicitly maintained a Maoist position that within the large imperialist states the working-class is too content to mount resistance against the bourgeoisie which operates in alliance with the labour aristocracy and petite-bourgeoisie.

this is hilarious when you look at the actual article they are quoting:

>The working class constitutes the majority of the people in Britain, and as Marxists we recognise that they must because of their subject position be the leading force for revolutionary change in this country. It is composed of people of all genders and nationalities, the able and the disabled and includes the employed and unemployed. It is the class which lives entirely from the sale of its labour and does not draw profit from any kind of capital.

and RFB's supposed contempt for unions that polisturm talks about is just them saying any revolutionary action within trade unions will happen in spite of labor aristocratic (which RFB claims is a minority strata of the overall working class) leadership. if this is a Maoist class analysis, I guess Maoism predated the Communist Party of China. it's very funny that polisturm has moved to the right of Lenin in debating an analysis that they would probably agree with if their hatred for Maoism didn't make them allergic to the term ""labor aristocracy"" in all its uses. this group seems to be completely unserious.",Zhang_Chunqiao
"On the Dissolution of ""Red Fightback""",https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/121r9jl/on_the_dissolution_of_red_fightback/,Labor-Aristocrat,"> Even in the imperialist nations, the workers had won extraordinary power, the Communist Parties of France and Italy for instance being included in coalition governments. But, the bourgeoisie, fearful that proletarian forces would soon be strong enough to overthrow them in their current weakened position, led a counterattack against the Communist Parties. It did not do this by way of overt reaction, illusioning the public of its real nature to avoid a popular rebuff and the revolution to threaten the position of bourgeois class-rule. Social-democracy was the most appropriate weapon; the possibility of revolution was averted as the proletariat was satiated by a number of measures that materially improved their lives.

What's not mentioned is the revisionism of these eurocommunist parties, nor their role in supplanting revolution with social fascism. And there's also the typical characterization of the masses being tricked by the bourgeoisie.

The article asserts that the labor aristocracy (I'm surprised they even used that term) is a revolutionary force by their opposition to the haute bourgeoisie, but this could easily be imperialist infighting and the article does not address this.

Still, it's interesting seeing the organizational failures and how yet another party was a sexual assault scandal away from dissolution, but with a twist.

> Only a few months later, in January of 2023, did the party implode. The immediate cause of this was the new CC expelling a black member after allegations of sexual assault were brought against him and he refused to take part in a reconciliation process. The group, being formed in the aftermath of an assault scandal in the RCG, took a strong approach against individuals that had been accused of sexual misconduct. The Racially Oppressed Caucus’ secretary though felt slighted that they were not properly consulted and involved in this case. The ROC felt that ‘the “utilisation of the privacy of a personal relationship” (i.e., the request of the survivor of sexual assault for anonymity) was used to shut out a systematic investigation into racism.’[¹⁶](https://www.ebb-magazine.com/essays/red-fightbacks-final-crisis?ref=us.politsturm.com)

Something about the article writer wording it as the racially oppressed ""felt that"" feels slimy.",Zhang_Chunqiao
"On the Dissolution of ""Red Fightback""",https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/121r9jl/on_the_dissolution_of_red_fightback/,InfectedWithNyanites,"""gave its branches a large amount of autonomy and the group itself was actually a collection of caucuses working in tandem with the central offices of the party to formulate political lines and strategy""

This point would seemingly be in contradiction to this point

""there was an organisational weakness and lack of ability for cadres to be able to debate and inform the central leadership of any issues""

If the center is making all the decisions about policy unilaterally and demanding the rest of the group stick to points they disagree with without ever having a chance to object or hash them out in a debate so that a majority consensus can be reached youve got an excess of centralism if there isnt any discussion on the policy and cooperation in deciding what it should be then the democracy aspect of the democratic centralism is missing. 

The former quote seems to imply that they think too little discipline was the issue that each caucus had too much autonomy to decide its own line seperately without any comsensus across the organization. But the second quote seems to suggest that the problem was the central leadership wasnt interested in hearing their disagreements and not committed to debate which seems like the opposite problem. 

""a lingering reluctance to air political debates out in the open. Instead there remained a vicious cycle of intensive criticism – often in the form of bombing the party headquarters""

This is also incoherent they were afraid to debate things with their leadership openly so instead they stated their greivances and criticisms openly to the group? What am I supposed to make of this was internal debate muffled by an air of bureacratic obstinance cowing everyone into conformity or were they too undisciplined? 

Bombing the party headquarters would here mean making publically known the mistakes and failings of the central leadership. Is the criticism that greivances werent presented to the leadership? That they were never confronted directly with a criticism and instead bypassed them and made their opinions known to the rest of the organization? If its that nobody ever asked them ""hey whats up with this?"" Is that because the leadership wasnt interested in listening and taking debate seriously?

The picture being painted is what? A central leadership dogmatically committed to not being a leadership and unwilling to debate the point with anyone else such that they force the whole group to abide by their not telling the rest of the group what to do? 

It kind of feels like this article throws out every criticism the author could think of even when they're conflicting and doesn't really give me any kind of coherent picture what exactly these people's issues were at all.",Zhang_Chunqiao

“The world has since changed extraordinarily. Counter-revolution has triumphed and the bourgeoisie, seeing no need to maintain the numerous social benefits previously afforded to the working-class as well as to open up new avenues of profit-making, has rolled back the welfare state.”


No doubt this is true, but this piece doesn’t even recognize the existence of superprofits that the imperial core proletariat benefits from, and it doesn’t even attempt to articulate how this affects our struggle or what needs to be done as a result.

"On the Dissolution of ""Red Fightback""",https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/121r9jl/on_the_dissolution_of_red_fightback/,InfectedWithNyanites,"The problem with the trade unions is that their leadership has betrayed the working class for the benefit of a privileged minority of union members whove been bribed to reject the class struggle in favor of spineless compromising that doesnt represent the interests of the workers.

Argument here is that if you dont engage with the trade unions the less politically developed more backwards sections of the working class will be abandoned to their malignant influence. Problem is that its harder to realize seizing power within unions from reactionary opportunists than to recognize what the issue is. The reactionary trade unions are structured to isolate and eject genuine revolutionaries. The way trade unions ran by liberals are structured also can lend itself to insulating the leadership from accountability to the will of the rank and file. The procedures and rules of the union can be used to grind you into conformity with its own internal processes. Different country but taft hartley in the US for example explicitly forbids communists from leading unions. Or look at how the IWW went through a period of illegality where all their leadership was imprisoned which crippled them for decades. Obviously the difficulty isnt a reason to stop trying.

I think its unfair to call avoidance of the corrupt unions a commitment to artificial forms of working class organizing it all depends on whats concretely meant by this. The issue is that theres radical demands and militancy being expressed by the workers but their old so called leadership is unwilling to take up the call and commit to a serious struggle and stop being friends with the bourgeoise. 

If when they say we shouldnt bother with the trade unions because of that they mean we should form our own new trade unions which will actually be committed to the fight then thats not necessarily a bad thing. Only it makes it a hundred times more difficult to recruit and organize from stratch with no established resources or training. 

I suppose the objection is that there are workers who've internalized reactionary economist mindsets still operating in the corrupt trade unions who aren't involved in this other alternative labor organizing and regard it with suspicion. In regards to them our job is to educate them to wake them up and pull them forwards which is a bit different than the matter of how we can oust the opportunists from these institutions and slavage them.

If the whole rank and file is angry and dissatisfied with their leaders then it would be difficult for them to maintain their position at the head when its seen as illegitimate. Its not easy to convince that many people at that big a scale that the way things are being ran right now is wrong when you're a minority with limited resources. 

I think a part of it is a fear that if you get bogged down in a fundamentally reformist struggle then you'll lose your revolutionary commitment and perspective. Its widely recognized that trying to change the bourgeoise political machine from the inside is a futile and doomed effort since the machine chews idealist reformers up and spits them out. 

What's happening here is they're seeing the old unions as part of that machine the fake controlled opposition to compliment the bourgeoise the astroturfed leadership of the workers to prevent them from pursuing a real struggle. The task of communists is to be that real leadership and you do this by being at the forefront of the struggle which is in the trade unions but the trade unions are just one form of it and we cant limit ourselves to that. Building the communist party isn't a commitment to an artificial doomed type of organizing even though the party is distinctly seperate from the unions and unlike them scorns the notion of being apolitical.",Zhang_Chunqiao

>The PCR does not argue we're even in the stage of strategic defensive in the concrete context of Canada. The point is that we should be mobilizing with a Peoples War in mind, but the stage we're at is an accumulation of revolutionary forces. The nPCI on the other hand seems to think that the PPW starts as soon as a party is formed, which is clearly adventurist.

For them, PPW is what should be pushed into the indeterminate future rather than insurrection. In theory this sounds different but in practice it is the same. The essential Maoist truth, that every moment contains a revolutionary contradiction and therefore revolution is a task of the present, is too terrifying. Better to do what everyone else does in order to ""accumulate forces.""

Honestly, the biggest action communists should be taking to combat the housing issue in this country is sustained squatting movements, which Engels identified as ""the only immediate remedy to the housing crisis"" long ago.

Opinions on the invasion of Hungary and Czechoslovakia,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12lp3bn/opinions_on_the_invasion_of_hungary_and/,2SchoolAFool,"i'm not too sure about Czechoslovakia, but regarding Hungary there are two primary tendencies that lead to some severe oversight when assessing the situation in Hungary leading up to and after 1956

1. A hyperfocus on the invasion itself without consideration of the preceding events
2. hyper-focus on the appearance of ""Worker's Councils"" without analyzing their underlying conditions, and key actors

the uprising in Hungary is often characterized as a moment when the Hungarian people, in pursuit of a project more radical and further left than the current implemented Soviet system, decided to form worker's councils. As such, people perceive the intervention of the USSR as wanting to crush a ""more true leftist project""

however, that was not entirely the case. Hungary was one of the last feudalistic states in Europe in the 1940s, and as a consequence of such conditions, had a very notorious and prominent reactionary element, encapsulated by the Catholic Church and the Hungarian cardinals most specifically Cardinal Mindszenty who was in direct contact with the CIA, the brutal and Nazi-collaborationist Horthy regency, and the ultranationalist and fascistic Arrow Cross party founded and led by Ferenc Szalasi

prior to the late 50s, MI6 had made contact with despondent Arrow Cross members who had fallen from prominence with the fall of Nazi Germany and Hungary's signing of the Warsaw Pact with the USSR. MI6 trained and armed former Arrow Cross members in nearby countries like Austria. additionally, Radio Free Europe was beaming agitating propaganda into Hungary to stir the latent reactionary and reactionary elements into action.

eventually, the combination of materiel support from MI6 and ideological support from the CIA via Radio Free Europe, the counter-revolutionary elements became emboldened and began taking action. These actions first began with restarting of the Hungarian pogroms - fascists and reactionaries would paint the homes of Jews with black crosses, where they later would be attacked often at night by reactionary elements. These attacks increased until many Hungarian Jews found themselves  concentrated in Budapest, and when the pogroms extended into the urban center, it sparked the second largest Hungarian Jewish migration from central Europe to the Americas since WW2. Next, armed reactionaries began seizing factories under the guise of wanting to run worker's council, but with the demand that these factories and assets won't be fully collectivized until after the Soviets pulled out. Things eventually escalated into the public lynching and killings of Hungarian communist partisans and party bureaucrats. A list of demands were written up by the reactionary contingent which included the liberation of former Nazi collaborators from prison - this reactionary list of demands can be known as the 16-Point Demands, most commonly cited and easily found on wikipedia.

counter to this counterrevolutionary contingent, there was indeed a genuine vein of revolutionary-left aspiration, encapsulated by students, some intellectual organizations, and a few peasant committees. They had a separate list of 9 demands, most famously documented by Hungarian Political Scientist and communist Tamas Krausz ""On the Worker's Councils of 1956"", that list included what can be considered more classically left concessions than what the 16-point list called for. however, this left-aspiring contingent did not have the same level of support that the reactionaries did, and so their demands and their history not only fell largely forgotten, but they held little influence in comparison to the armed and agitated reactionaries, again many of them supporters of the former Horthy regency or outright fascists who were members of  the former Arrow Cross party.

in short, contrary to popular belief, in which the moment is framed as the Soviets going in to crush a more progressive project of leftism, the situation in 1956 is more accurately described as the Soviets simply responding to reactionary uprising in Hungary that was likely to escalate into full on worker's suppression, anti-Semitic pogroms, and the liberation of nazi warm criminals, and further threaten the already precarious Warsaw Pact bloc

Opinions on the invasion of Hungary and Czechoslovakia,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12lp3bn/opinions_on_the_invasion_of_hungary_and/,supper828,"I can’t speak too much on this as I need to do more research myself, but put plainly— is it really self determination if the US is orchestrating a color revolution?

There is well documented American influence and agitation in these places. I think it’s important that Marxists look for the “why?” before they assign value judgements to decisions. In the eyes of the USSR, regardless of your moral position, they saw this as protecting these nations against the west, who tried to actively undermine socialist projects.

I think the place to start is with looking into the US and its role in color revolutions, and then further into what they did when these things failed, such as when the communists were still able to win elections in Bulgaria and Albania following the collapse of the USSR.

I think the issue is massively nuanced and isn’t as simple as applying a value judgement, but simply put, these nations had political autonomy, and the USSR would not have intervened had they not thought the US was actively undermining these attempts at self determination.

——

As an aside, I sympathize fully with your desire to learn more, as my mothers family is all from Hungary and is wholly dogmatically opposed to the USSR. All we can hope to do is try to analyze the situation as honestly as possible, looking at the motivations of the political actors while also assessing the variable material conditions of the peoples in question, namely being, the working mass. This applies particularly to the conditions prior to and following socialist construction in these nations, and further into the rapidly deteriorating situations they found themselves in during and after socialist deconstruction in the 80’s and 90’s.",Jazzlike-Permission9

Invasion of Poland,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/128ejs8/invasion_of_poland/,psittachus,"The USSR's position in 1939 can only be understood in connection with its policy against fascism throughout the 30's, the risk of an anticommunist crusade that had not disappeared since the imperialist powers' intervention in the Russian Civil War, and the role of Poland as an anticommunist and militaristic state that could easily be used as a weapon to destroy socialism.

As you mentioned, there were attempts at an an anti-Germany coalition between the French, the Soviets and the British. This was simply one of the several moves by the USSR to defeat fascism during the 30's. Even before their rise to power, the USSR understood the Nazi party to be part of a broader pattern of militaristic and anticommunist states who could ultimately serve Britain and France by invading the USSR and destroying the socialist state. Through the Comintern they made attempts, some more succesful than others, to prevent the accession of fascist parties in Europe, eventually deploying the ""Popular Front"" strategy, which permitted collaboration with non-working class parties (including in imperialist countries) with the view that it was necessary to defend the only socialist state from being wiped out.

By 1939, the main situation which the USSR wished to avoid was Germany attacking them with Britain and France either staying neutral or providing support. Poland had taken part in the partition of Czechoslovakia and alongside Germany had been sending spies and saboteurs into the USSR throughout the 1930's. Soviet policymakers foresaw the possibility of Germany invading Poland and then quickly turning that into a war to destroy the USSR with Britain and France allowing it to take place. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact made such a war very unlikely and by the time the USSR did fight Germany, it had been able to use the meantime to prepare and did not have to worry about the Baltic states (which were in some ways similar to Poland politically in terms of their view of the USSR) joining the attack or Germany being able to begin their attack from western Ukraine and Belarus (the parts of Poland which the USSR took in 1939 had been taken by Poland during the Civil War and were inhabited mainly by Ukrainians and Belarusians). In this way, the territorial provisions of the pact greatly increased the USSR's ability to fight Germany.

If you want to read about this, I recommend Anna Louise Strong's *The Stalin Era,* specifically the part about WWII which deals with the timeline of how the Soviets did not want the war to happen. Also, Geoffrey Roberts' *Stalin's Wars* deals with this subject in one of its earlier chapters and Harris and Davies' *Stalin's World* goes over the threats to the USSR posed by the imperialist powers. All of these save Strong's are written by bourgeois writers.",SilasMcSausey

On the so-called World Anti-Imperialist Platform and its damaging and disorienting position,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12ka7ub/on_the_socalled_world_antiimperialist_platform/,smokeuptheweed9,">Imperialism is monopoly capitalism. In the present imperialist system, all capitalist states are integrated into it and are characterized by relations of unequal interdependence,  competition and cooperation. This certainly does not mean that they have the same power and capabilities; it means that all bourgeois classes participate in the sharing of the spoils, in the sharing of the surplus value produced by the working class across the world, based on the political, military and economic power of each state.

On the so-called World Anti-Imperialist Platform and its damaging and disorienting position,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12ka7ub/on_the_socalled_world_antiimperialist_platform/,urbaseddad,"This part seems to be a critique of the policy of the former international communist movement and the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, and also seems to me to contradict the Maoist line of the CPP and similar organizations.

>Thus, the USA is distortedly presented as an empire of a modern colonial system, where all the states allied to it are its subordinates.
>
>[...]
>
>The WAP’s approach about the need “to overturn the colonial system”, about national sovereignty and the creation of regional unions of “sovereign states”, overlook in an unhistorical manner the fact that the colonial system has been a thing of the past for decades now. In its place have appeared dozens of “sovereign” states and in each one unresolved class contradictions exist between capital and the working class. Furthermore, the present relations between the “sovereign” bourgeois states are governed by relations of uneven interdependence, in which all bourgeois classes are involved according to their power —a fact that is missing from the WAP’s analysis.
>
>[...]
>
>According to WAP’s perception, all problems arise from foreign interference, from the imposition of the will of imperialist powers, and primarily of the USA, in each country. In practice, it seeks to forge alliances in the bosom of the so-called national bourgeoisie. Apart from the confusion over imperialism, an underestimate of the international character of the era of monopoly capitalism, which is reflected in every capitalist state with the sharpening of the basic contradiction between capital and labour and the strengthening of the tendency of the absolute and relative deterioration of the position of the working class, is also apparent.
>
>The above erroneous approach is not new since it conveys erroneous approaches that had prevailed for many years in the international communist movement and focused on the differentiated level of development of the productive forces, wrongly assuming that any delay was due exclusively to a state’s foreign dependency and not to historical factors such as the delay in the emergence of capitalist relations, the relatively small national market, the historical conditions that pushed the bourgeoisie of a capitalist state to invest e.g. in the export of energy or in shipping capital rather than in industry. In this context, the strategy of stages towards socialism was developed, where the initial stage was to throw off of “foreign dependency” and establish “national sovereignty”, which would be achieved through an alliance with the “nationally oriented” bourgeoisie in opposition to the “comprador”, dependent and subordinated to the dictates of the imperialists bourgeoisie.
>
>Today we know that the fragmentation of the CP’s strategy into stages has failed! Similarly, the separation of the bourgeoisie into “subservient to foreigners” and “patriotic” and the attempt to form an alliance with the latter section has proved to be unrealistic. The bourgeoisie, despite certain differentiations of economic interests that may exist within it, has its own uniform tool to exploit the working class and oppress the popular strata, i.e. the bourgeois state. The bourgeois state also acts as a regulator for any differences between the various sections of the bourgeoisie. Each national bourgeois state (today there are about 200 of them across the world) contributes to the formulation of the strategy of the country’s bourgeoisie and manages its international alliances, its participation in one or another inter-state union of capitalist states, where the laws of the capitalist economy apply together with the inter-state regulations.

Is this analysis correct? To what extent does it contradict the line of the Comintern and CPSU? To what extent does it contradict the Maoist line of parties like the CPP?",Zhang_Chunqiao

School Board Candidate advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12n94xh/school_board_candidate_advice/,PrincipallyMaoism,"Hello, I am actually a teacher and a leader of our local chapter of a yellow-character teachers union I will not name. I should mention that while your ambition is noble, school boards are required by law to exist in virtually all states to govern public education. This is an instrumental part of the bourgeois system of checks and balances.

What you are essentially advocating for is reformism, and a strategy that has been widely criticized by Lenin. That being said, while we should be deeply critical of electoralism and reformist positions, I do not think you should suspend your candidacy. However, you should speak with local teachers and advocate on their behalf with your position, but recognize how deeply limiting your role will be as it retains a specific class character.

In my own organizational work, I and other revolutionary teachers see the benefit of the creation of red (revolutionary) fractions of these unions, thereby applying class politics and putting power in the hands of the teachers and school workers, arming workers with revolutionary ideology, and supporting the goal of reconstitution of the Communist Party, the formation of the People's Army, and building the United Front. In other words, the enterprise of School Boards will one day be abolished.

Teachers will not have power vested in them from the school board or the Old State. We must SEIZE that power, and that will only truly happen when Workers as a whole begin to SEIZE power in industry, thus the United Front.

I would also like to caution you on terminology like ""Collective Ownership"". That isn't exactly what Marxism is embracing and can be a misnomer. Socialism is not collective ownership, it is proletarian power!",EnvironmentalTask543

The danger in this approach is that many of the abstractions of Dialectical Materialism will lack an object absent of the other two components, but I've found that many students who go for a more ""well-rounded"" approach will interpret the historical and economic content (particularly the historical) within a liberal framework and thus find themselves having to relearn later. That's not to say you won't have to relearn anything — you will — but applying the historical and economic contexts to the philosophy is the most efficient approach in my experience. That said, here's a syllabus for a philosophical introduction,

(i) *Principles of Communism* by Engels, which is a question-and-answer pamphlet about the basics of the ideology. I find students have an easier time digesting this than the Manifesto.

(ii) *The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism* by Lenin. This piece is a dozen-page or so work about the schools of thought that influenced Marx — mainly English political economy, French socialism, and German philosophy.

(iii) *Karl Marx* by Lenin is another handful-of-pages long pamphlet that serves as a brief biography of Marx. It's useful to know the personal history of the man as you'll be able to see this reflected in his work.

(iv) *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific* by Engels. This one's where the fun starts, it goes over the history of idealism, early materialism, and how the latter evolved into Marxist materialism.

(iv) *Anti-Dühring*, by Engels, is a philosophical polemic which further contextualizes the development of historical materialism within the intellectual topography of its time.

(v) Vol 1 of *The German Ideology* by Marx. Though it's called a volume, it's not too too long. I only recommend this part (the one on Feuerbach) as the other two volumes are polemics on old German figures who are interesting for historical reasons, but less so for Marxism101 purposes.

If are very interested in the economics and want to break from my recommended philosophy-focus, you can insert *Wage Labor and Capital* and *Value Price and Profit*, both by Marx, between (iii) and (iv).

Stop US and Chinese aggression in the Philippines! Turn imperialist wars into wars against imperialism!,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12qbsft/stop_us_and_chinese_aggression_in_the_philippines/,FiveSkeletonsInACoat,"Greetings of solidarity!

Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN) Laguna is calling on all patriotic, progressive, and anti-imperialist forces all over the world to support our call for peace and against imperialism this upcoming April 22.

The Philippines is caught in an inter-imperialist rivalry between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. The US has long held the Philippines as its semi-colony, while China is keen on taking this away from the US. This coincides with wider tensions in the South East Asia region, including rows in Taiwan and the South China Sea.

The US is currently exerting its massive influence in the Philippines to militarize and fund the reactionary Marcos Jr. regime. It has established at least 9 declared military bases and has sent 12,200 US troops for joint military exercises with the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Meanwhile, the US is funding the Marcos Jr. regime to continue its dirty war against democratic forces and to crush all progressive and revolutionary movements in the country.

We are calling on the peace loving, progressive, and anti-imperialist peoples of the world to support us in opposing imperialist aggression. We hope that you can take the time to read and sign our solidarity statement: [http://bit.ly/StandWithPH](http://bit.ly/StandWithPH)

The statement will be released by BAYAN on April 22, to coincide with the birth of one of the world's greatest anti-imperialists, Vladimir Lenin. Additionally, we hope that your organization can release statements in support of the Filipino peoples' struggle.

Thank you very much and more power!",FiveSkeletonsInACoat

How to read government statistics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/126iqpq/how_to_read_government_statistics/,TheReimMinister,"My advice is not to worry so much. The worst thing you can do is take your ignorance of these things you've read about as a sign of intellectual inferiority, and therefore rush to understand everything everywhere all at once. Quite the opposite! Your curiosity, your ""gut-feeling"" about the world, should be carefully nurtured with discipline in your study, not burnt out with endless tasks to simultaneously follow! It doesn't matter if you start with one concept to learn (one relation) because you are destined to arrive at all the others in turn (if they are really meaningful). This is not only the true development of the subject matter itself; in your study you will find yourself constantly testing your reading with real-world observations, clarifying questions, and small divergences to related topics as you come across points of misunderstanding. Here you must not give up, as these points of misunderstanding and mistakes are signs of potential progress in your learning!

But why are we impelled to damper this active side of ourselves? 

Because bourgeois science has lost its revolutionary potential  (having accompanied bourgeois social relations to its peak under capitalist imperialism) knowledge production under the bourgeois project as a whole has lost its impetus. Bourgeois science now operates under the assumption that we have reached the end of history (and therefore that the constantly arising problems in society are the result of blips in the ideal system) and has to state that ""truth is relative"" in order to present the illusion of progress in knowledge production. A smart person is supposed to know a little bit of everything in order to diagnose society from an infinite number of angles, which helps them to carve out a lucrative space for themselves in the academic competition and be able to briefly comment on the worthless dribble of their academic contemporaries (who are doing the same thing they are). The dialectical process of knowledge accumulation, a collective project of humanity atomized by private property and commodity production, is thereby *fettered*. Is it any wonder that a child, who has developed since infancy by the constant internalization of their social/material world (of which they take on a growingly active role as they age), struggles when they confront this smothering environment (either giving up or hopelessly distracted, thus diagnosed with a learning disorder)?

In your entire life up until this point, your learning has closed infinitesimal gaps between what you know and what you need to know, on the pathway to closing the larger gap between historically accumulated Knowledge (of collective human beings) and what is not yet known through human activity not yet undertaken. The truth has been found in the result along with the process of arriving at it. Through social relations with your aged peers (parents, teachers) you have internalized the collective knowledge of humanity, piece by piece, and have ended up with more and more questions along the way. This *is* knowledge.

Bourgeois science smothers humanity's potential thinkers in the crib by subterraneanly enforcing the assumption that mistakes and ignorance of potential knowledge (contradictions) are signs of sickeness instead of the *key* to the system, the *telltale sign of progression*. Hence the most insufferable people are the ""progressives"" *who refuse to be wrong and refuse criticism as the path to collective knowledge building*.

Lenin said this:

>  To begin with what is the simplest, most ordinary, common, etc., with any proposition: the leaves of a tree are green; John is a man: Fido is a dog, etc. Here already we have dialectics (as Hegel’s genius recognised): the individual is the universal. Consequently, the opposites (the individual is opposed to the universal) are identical: the individual exists only in the connection that leads to the universal. The universal exists only in the individual and through the individual. 

So take a deep breath and remember that every single human being, of all classes, is capable of learning and contributing to the collective project of Knowledge. Choose one thing to begin with and embrace the contradiction in your learning. If that's *Capital*, great, but it doesn't have to be (although you should read it at some point as it is one of the greatest leaps made it science to date, and we need to stand on it to make further progress) - you are just as capable of reading *Capital* now as you will be later, and you will likely come back to it anyway. If it's a text on materialist dialectics, that's also good. The only failure is if your don't start.

There are resources here on the subreddit that you can peruse as well. [This post, for instance](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/11ouffj/some_words_of_encouragement_for_younger_and/), can provide you with further encouragement.

Good luck!

How to read government statistics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/126iqpq/how_to_read_government_statistics/,psittachus,"There are a lot of questions in what you wrote, but for your main question, I recommend looking for something to read about the history and political economy of the country which you are studying. Most countries have Marxist movements that have studied their history and already produced class analyses on which we can base our own analysis.

I think you are leaning in the right direction of trying to identify the classes within this country and what they subsist on, how they interact with other classes, and how they are expressing themselves politically. However, your understanding needs to be focused on your society specifically. Does it have a labour aristocracy or a comprador bourgeoisie? As you said, you have to carry out a materialist analysis. You can start from scratch using Capital or you can rely on what others have written. If you are a student doing an assignment, the second option is much easier.

I don't know which country you are writing about, but people here might have book recommendations for you to look into.",violet4ever4

Bi-Weekly Discussion Thread - 31 March,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/127cxwc/biweekly_discussion_thread_31_march/,TheReimMinister,"A passage from Ilyenkov on concrete theory:

> If we insist that the demand for comprehensive consideration of all facts, of all the elements of interaction alone can ensure genuinely concrete knowledge, that is only true on condition that the requirement of ‘all round consideration’ itself is interpreted dialectically. This point is important, because this requirement is most frequently and willingly exploited in the speculations within one of the anti-scientific forms of thought – creeping empiricism posing as theoretical thought.
> 
> Lenin, a genius at applying revolutionary dialectics, many times warned, following Marx, against confusing the dialectical conception of concreteness with its eclectic parody, the more so that this confusion often acquired direct political meaning.
> 
> **‘In falsifying Marxism in opportunist fashion, the substitution of eclecticism for dialectics is the easiest way of deceiving the people. If gives an illusory satisfaction; it seems to take into account all sides of the process, all trends of development, all the conflicting influences, and so forth, whereas in reality it provides no integral and revolutionary conception of the process of social development at all.’** [Lenin, State & Revolution]
> 
> These words clearly refer – not only to social development but to any field of knowledge or activity, thereby containing a universal logical requirement.
> 
> One of the most widely used arguments of the enemies of scientific communism fighting against the theory of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, is accusation of this theory and the political line following from it, of ‘stubborn one-sidedness’, ‘abstractedness’, ‘lack of flexibility’, etc.
> 
> A characteristic example of eclectic falsification of dialectics is Bukharin’s opportunist position in the discussion on the trade unions at the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Assuming the posture of an arbiter in the controversy between the Party and the Trotsky group, Bukharin made an attempt at a philosophical substantiation of his position. In his arguments against Bukharin’s position, Lenin showed brilliantly the deep essence of the dialectical interpretation of the concreteness of the truth. This episode is very instructive for logic as a science.
> 
> Let us briefly recall the circumstances of this philosophical controversy. The debate concerned the principles of Party policy on trade unions. The Party’s position on this point, recorded in a number of documents, was as follows: Soviet trade unions are a ‘school of communism’. This short formula assumed that trade unions by their place and role in the system of the proletarian dictatorship, are a mass organisation whose goal is the education and enlightenment of the masses in the spirit of communism, and preparation of the masses for conscious participation in the management of the national economy. This conception was opposed by Trotsky, who formulated his own platform, regarding trade unions, first and foremost, as an ‘administrative technical apparatus for production control’. That was a conflict of two clear-cut positions, two political lines – the Leninist policy, of the Party and the leftist policy of Trotskyism, the notorious policy of ‘tightening the nuts’.
> 
> In this situation Bukharin made an excursion into the field of philosophy trying to find in it a substantiation of his political position, a position that allegedly reconciled the opposing extremes.
> 
> The formula of the Leninist Party defined trade unions as ‘the school of communism’, Trotsky’s formula, as ‘administrative technical apparatus of control’, while Bukharin reasoned thus:
> 
> ‘I see no logical grounds for proof that either proposition is wrong; both, and a combination of both, are right.’
> 
> Lenin sharply condemned this ‘logical’ argument: ‘When Comrade Bukharin speaks of ""logical"" grounds, his whole reasoning shows that he takes – unconsciously, perhaps – the standpoint of formal or scholastic logic, and not of dialectical or Marxist logic.’ [Lenin, January 25 1921]
> 
> Taking up the elementary example used by Bukharin during the polemics, Lenin gave a brilliant demonstration of the difference between the dialectical interpretation of comprehensive consideration’ and its eclectic variant.
> 
> A ‘logical argument’ of the ‘on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand’ type, an argument more or less accidentally isolating various aspects of the objects and placing them in more or less accidental connection, was rightly ridiculed by Lenin as argument in the spirit of scholastic formal logic.
> 
> ‘A tumbler is assuredly both a glass cylinder and a drinking vessel. But there are more than these two properties, qualities or facets to it; there are an infinite number of them, an infinite number of ""mediacies"" and inter-relationships with the rest of the world. A tumbler is a heavy object which can be used as a missile; it can serve as a paperweight, a receptacle for a captive butterfly, or a valuable object with an artistic engraving or design, and this has nothing at all to do with whether or not it can be used for drinking, is made of glass, is cylindrical or not quite, and so on and so forth.’
> 
> **Reasoning gliding from one abstract one-sided definition of the object to another, just as abstract and one-sided, is endless and does not lead to anything definite.** If the Party reasoned about trade unions according to this principle, there could be no hope for any principled, scientifically worked-out political line. It would have been tantamount to a complete rejection of a theoretical attitude to things in general.
> 
> The position of the Party, clearly expressed by Lenin, in no way rejects the fact that tinder different social conditions and at different stages in the development of society, trade unions can play different roles and be used for different purposes, and that the forms of their Organisation and methods of work may vary accordingly.
> 
> **But a concrete formulation of the problem proceeding from a realisation of the role which trade unions play or may play objectively**, irrespective of someone’s desires or aspirations, in the system of the organs of proletarian dictatorship during the transition from capitalism to socialism, leads to the conclusion that trade unions are not one thing, on the one hand, and another thing, on the other, but, looked at from all sides, are a school of communism and a school of communism only, a school of unity, a school of solidarity, a school of the defence of the proletariat’s interests by the proletariat itself, a school of management and administration.
> 
> Lenin stresses this point particularly, pointing out that in the polemics against the erroneous platform propounded by Trotsky, trade unions have to be regarded as a school and in no other way. For that is their only objective role, their goal prompted by their position in the system of proletarian dictatorship.
> 
> If anyone should use a tumbler not the way it ought to be used – say, as a missile rather than a drinking vessel, there is no great harm in that. But when such an ‘object’ as trade unions is involved, the whole thing may end in a disaster. That was why the RCP(B) reacted so strongly to Trotsky’s platform according to which trade unions are an ‘administrative technical apparatus for production control’, and to Bukharin’s attempt to justify this interpretation as a ‘one-sided’ one.
> 
> Lenin stands by the view that this platform cannot be accepted either as an exhaustive definition or as an abstract one-sided definition of the essence of trade unions.
> 
> The concrete historical role, purpose, and place of trade unions in the system of organs of proletarian dictatorship are only expressed in the Party position: Soviet trade unions, any way you look at them, are a school. All other definitions are derivative from this basic, principal, and determining one. This definition expresses the specific nature of trade unions, the reason why they can play their role as an organ of proletarian dictatorship side by side with the Party and state and in close cooperation with them.
> 
> **That was why Lenin, continuing the ironic analogy with the tumbler, defines Trotsky’s position as that of a man who wants to use the tumbler for its real purpose, as an instrument for drinking, but wishes that it should have no bottom.** While regarding Soviet trade unions as an instrument of proletarian dictatorship, Trotsky rejects precisely that which enables them to play their specific and necessary role distinct from the role of the state. ‘His (Trotsky’s) platform says that a tumbler is a drinking vessel, but this particular tumbler happens to have no bottom.’
> 
> As for Bukharin’s position, Lenin describes it as dead and meaningless eclecticism, that is, senseless enumeration of one abstract definition of the object after another, an enumeration that does not stop at anything concrete and does not lead anywhere, merely disconcerting the Party.
> 
> To both these platforms Lenin opposes a clear, principled, and concrete position of the Party: Soviet trade unions are an instrument of communist education of the broad working masses, a school of communist unity, solidarity, defence of the interests of the proletariat from the bureaucratic elements in the state organs, a school of management and administration, it is an instrument for transforming the working people into conscious builders of communism.
> 
> This concrete definition expresses an objective role of trade unions in the system of organisations implementing the socialist transformation of society, that is, their essence and nature independent of someone’s caprice or subjective goals.

I like this passage because it shows the Leninist defense of materialist dialectics against Trotsky and Bukharin as a historical example, and it is just as easily levelled against philosophical enemies of our day, say, postmodern relative truth",AutoModerator

> Speaking with POLITICO and two French journalists after spending around six hours with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip, Macron emphasized his pet theory of “strategic autonomy” for Europe, presumably led by France, to become a “third superpower.”

This whole development is pretty interesting but I think the ""third superpower"" thing is mainly posturing given that China would obviously be against a reindustrialization (and subsequent reproletarianization) of Europe. The article also barely mentions Russia at all which is strange since Europe is basically reliant on Russia for natural resources if the US is out of the equation, unless my knowledge is outdated and the situation has changed since the Nordstream sabotage.",AutoModerator

This post is locked so I can't comment on it anymore, but I wanted to see if you could expand on this part of your comment:

>Southern whites may see themselves as just as good as any Californian but settler capitalism has determined that they must play a special role in enforcement of white supremacy. Cultural indexes create a common white regional identity which is purely negative: the largest country music starts today from from American idol, use the same producers as any other pop music, and the lyrics are postmodern, self-aware references from corporate spectacles. But negativity allows for a single common purpose of whiteness to exist among white people who otherwise wish to deny any relationship for the reasons outlined above. The same is true for corporate evangelical Christianity, which is as postmodern and spectacular as country music.

personally i just chose to read it on my own as is because trusting an annotated version is a very risky thing because its very subject to opinion and more likely than not its probably more anti communist garbage. id youre looking for a simplified version of the text you can just search up what ideas are presented by marx in the manifesto and go into more depth yourself. maybe somebody else will have what youre looking for but i think its better to ask around and learn yourself, and the communist manifesto isnt the only leftist writing out there theres so many that present so many different ideas and i just find it easier to do it on my own than trust another source. have a good day!",cheesitz_andbeer

[Cyprus Movements Archive] The Other EOKA - The Terror of Grivas' Mask-wearers,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/128jmrs/cyprus_movements_archive_the_other_eoka_the/,urbaseddad,"Thought it would be good to post this since today, 1st of April, is ""Cyprus National Day"" -- commemorating the start of the armed struggle of the right-wing, Greek nationalist, anti-communist, supposedly anti-colonial organization EOKA, led by Georgios Grivas, the former leader of the far-right, monarchist, and viciously anti-communist Organization X in Greece that attacked left-wingers during the Greek Resistance and fought on the reactionary side during the Greek Civil War.

Cypriot, Greek, Turkish, and other foreign bourgeois historiography all misrepresent the nature of EOKA:

* ""Greek"" Cypriot and Greek bourgeois historiography paints EOKA in an extremely positive light, as freedom-fighters and liberators. We never learn about the atrocities they committed against Turkish-speaking / Muslim and Greek-speaking / Christian Cypriots, especially those of left-wing / communist conviction. We never learn of the fact that this violence resulted in many times more deaths than the number of British colonial military and police personnel killed by EOKA. The fact that EOKA came into being fairly late into a prolonged, popular anti-colonial struggle that started towards the end of WW2 is conveniently left out.
* ""Turkish"" Cypriot and Turkish bourgeois historiography paints EOKA in an extremely negative light with the goal of painting their own right-wing, Turkish nationalist, anti-communist organization, the TMT, in a positive light in contrast. Of course, there is little to no mention of the contribution of ""Turkish"" Cypriots in the (left-wing) anti-colonial struggle.
* British bourgeois historiography paints EOKA as a terrorist organization to justify British colonial rule and repressionary measures, which actually targeted the left-wing anti-colonial movement as much as, if not more than, EOKA, under the guise of cracking down on ""terrorist"" anti-colonial activity.

This article does a good job at exposing the real nature of EOKA, which is not taught in schools in the southern (unoccupied, ""Greek speaking"") part of Cyprus or Greece, without justifying the Turkish nationalist or British colonial narratives.

KKE: On the so-called World Anti-Imperialist Platform and its damaging and disorienting position,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12ioqs5/kke_on_the_socalled_world_antiimperialist/,urbaseddad,"I wanted to share this article in general since I found it to be a good critique of the so-called World Anti-Imperialist Platform, which already seemed like a complete sham to me.

However, there is also something in the article that particularly caught my eye, something that seems to be a critique of the policy of the former international communist movement and the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, and also seems to me to contradict the Maoist line of the CPP and similar organizations.

>Thus, the USA is distortedly presented as an empire of a modern colonial system, where all the states allied to it are its subordinates.
>
>[...]
>
>The WAP’s approach about the need “to overturn the colonial system”, about national sovereignty and the creation of regional unions of “sovereign states”, overlook in an unhistorical manner the fact that the colonial system has been a thing of the past for decades now. In its place have appeared dozens of “sovereign” states and in each one unresolved class contradictions exist between capital and the working class. Furthermore, the present relations between the “sovereign” bourgeois states are governed by relations of uneven interdependence, in which all bourgeois classes are involved according to their power —a fact that is missing from the WAP’s analysis.
>
>[...]
>
>According to WAP’s perception, all problems arise from foreign interference, from the imposition of the will of imperialist powers, and primarily of the USA, in each country. In practice, it seeks to forge alliances in the bosom of the so-called national bourgeoisie. Apart from the confusion over imperialism, an underestimate of the international character of the era of monopoly capitalism, which is reflected in every capitalist state with the sharpening of the basic contradiction between capital and labour and the strengthening of the tendency of the absolute and relative deterioration of the position of the working class, is also apparent.
>
>The above erroneous approach is not new since it conveys erroneous approaches that had prevailed for many years in the international communist movement and focused on the differentiated level of development of the productive forces, wrongly assuming that any delay was due exclusively to a state’s foreign dependency and not to historical factors such as the delay in the emergence of capitalist relations, the relatively small national market, the historical conditions that pushed the bourgeoisie of a capitalist state to invest e.g. in the export of energy or in shipping capital rather than in industry. In this context, the strategy of stages towards socialism was developed, where the initial stage was to throw off of “foreign dependency” and establish “national sovereignty”, which would be achieved through an alliance with the “nationally oriented” bourgeoisie in opposition to the “comprador”, dependent and subordinated to the dictates of the imperialists bourgeoisie.
>
>Today we know that the fragmentation of the CP’s strategy into stages has failed! Similarly, the separation of the bourgeoisie into “subservient to foreigners” and “patriotic” and the attempt to form an alliance with the latter section has proved to be unrealistic. The bourgeoisie, despite certain differentiations of economic interests that may exist within it, has its own uniform tool to exploit the working class and oppress the popular strata, i.e. the bourgeois state. The bourgeois state also acts as a regulator for any differences between the various sections of the bourgeoisie. Each national bourgeois state (today there are about 200 of them across the world) contributes to the formulation of the strategy of the country’s bourgeoisie and manages its international alliances, its participation in one or another inter-state union of capitalist states, where the laws of the capitalist economy apply together with the inter-state regulations.

Is this analysis correct? To what extent does it contradict the line of the Comintern and CPSU? To what extent does it contradict the Maoist line of parties like the CPP?",urbaseddad

"1984 - Goldstein's Book, Chapter III",https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12fpk90/1984_goldsteins_book_chapter_iii/,NeedleworkerDouble79,"Unless you can prove it using in-text evidence from the book, you cannot just trust what any rando says about what each element of the book “represents”. This is an important element of all literary criticism and theory. Now if you want the typical Marxist critique of the book, think about the events in the story in terms of class. How is the working class represented? What is the main character’s class?

You’ll notice that Orwell portrays the proletariat as inherently lazy and incapable of political discipline and leadership. If I remember correctly he literally says the proles are too “stupid” to overthrow the party. Furthermore the text seems to view revolution itself as a futile act. I would argue that the main point of the book is that the working class is so stupid that if they ever overthrew a government, they would create a dictatorship that would let them be lazy and drunk and that it is impossible for them to rule in a civilized and kind manner. Theres also the fact that he portrays womens political organizations (obviously a parallel to such feminists groups in socialist countries) as sexless and that they are enslaved by their hatred of men. This shouldn’t be a spoiler, I’m fairly certain all of these things are already clear by the end of chapter 3^. I could say more but I’d risk spoiling that piece of toilet paper.

Aa for Trotsky specifically, Obviously goldstein represents him. At the time that the novel came out, Trotsky had made a name for himself in the west by demonizing the USSR and became something of a useful daring to the liberal world. Because he was dead in 1940, he became a harmless martyr icon that the west used to attack the soviet union. Its not at all an accurate representation of anything. Its a fictional representation of a mythologized icon version of trotsky, Because of that, I would recommend that when reading it, you should think about Goldstein as more of a plot device that helps establish the setting as a parody of the soviet union.",DeskDust
Is Marxism anti-psychiatry?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12kjiuk/is_marxism_antipsychiatry/,Proper_Apartment7644,"It means that a Marxist approach to psychiatry would apply the science to genuinely understand and address the well-being and needs of people. 

That would include studying and addressing the mental distress caused by an economic system which requires the mass of the population to remain in a survival state where failing to have a job leaves you to starve on the streets.

As opposed to Capitalist psychiatry which uses the science to hide the abuses and distress of this economic system by explaining the distress to be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain and entirely biological in its origins.

If you want to understand a Marxist perspective on psychiatry then read Franz Fanon.

His books will improve a person’s understanding of Marxism and psychiatry.",Puzzleheaded_Lack516
Is Marxism anti-psychiatry?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12kjiuk/is_marxism_antipsychiatry/,NinjaCalm2810,"1. I have a masters in IO Psychology. I am not a clinician.
2. All psychology students are given a basic intro to the DSM and abnormal psychology
3. I am not familiar with the papers you presented but will track them down

The root of the problem is contained in diagnostic criteria. Let's say that one of the symptoms used to identify depression is a significant change in sleep patterns, either an inability to sleep or oversleeping. Great, but what makes the change ""significant?"" The psychologist is trained to look for 'maladaptive' behaviors. Maladaptive means that it interferes with our ability to live life, i.e. it interferes with going to work. 

So if a psychologist is capable of addressing your symptoms to the point where you can return to success at work, then your treatment is successful. In this way, psychologists do not even need to explicitly support capital or work to indoctrinate people. They implicitly support capital through the fundamental aims of their work. 

Psychiatrists, for those who don't know, are medical doctors who specialize in mental issues and specifically are not psychologists or psychotherapists. Psychiatrists are often little more than pharmaceutical sales staff, pushing medications as interventions rather than providing actual psychological care. They still have the primary aim of returning you to your ability to work.",Puzzleheaded_Lack516

Is Marxism anti-psychiatry?,https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/12kjiuk/is_marxism_antipsychiatry/,variegatedcroton1,"Marxism doesn't adhere to the idea that mental illnesses arent ""real"", or that ""there is no need for psychiatric medicines"" necessarily. It goes far beyond that.

Essentially Marxism - and the philosophy of dialectical materialism - shows how nothing is static, nothing is permanent, social conceptions and definitions of illness and their treatment are constantly changing in accordance with the mode of production of society as a whole.

What does it mean for a mental illness to be ""real""? Lets take the example of ADHD, an example provided in the book ""Psychiatric Hegemony"". ADHD is ""real"" in the sense that millions of people believe they have it, take medications in accordance with their percieved diagnosis by the medical profession, thousands of med profs are taught how to diagnose, treat it, etc. So it is a very real social phenomenon. But does the conception of ""ADHD"" actually correspond to reality in that - does a having trouble focusing in school, as a child (when most people get diagnosed), having difficulty sitting still mean that you have a physical disorder of your brain and its chemistry, or a problem with your genes? Marxists say no. Marxists understand that what is considered ""ill"" or ""normal"" ""diseased"" is a matter of class struggle, and nothing is beyond class struggle - it is a continuous subject to change. And all those symptoms of ADHD are more readily explained as problems inherent to bourgeois education, the demands of the capitalist class for an efficient workforce, internalized by students and the petty bourgeoise as they feel they are necessary to be competitive in a ruthless market - and they are right maybe you do need these drugs to compete but it doesnt mean you have something objectively wrong with the structure of your brain.

Your second question- is there no need for psychiatric medicines? From the class position of the bourgeoisie, yes psychiatric medications are a necessity to maintain class rule insofar as they allow people to individualize social problems - depression due to the meaninglessness and brutality of life under capitalism gets made into a problem of individuals and the treatment on an individual basis. It is only ""necessary"" to have an individual treatment if there is no social solution- which the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeosie necessarily cannot provide. But from the class standpoint of the proletariat these medications are wholly unnecessary because they are a revolutionary class and do not need to be sedated - the future is theirs and they are more than capable of taking up social solutions to the problems they face.",Puzzleheaded_Lack516
