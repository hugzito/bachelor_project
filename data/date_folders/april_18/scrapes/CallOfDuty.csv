(Probably the most frustrating COD I've played, imo.) But the changing of the leveling system to the squad system, the character customization, and the perk system were all excellent. You'd think the Ghosts perk system would go hand in hand with the in-depth weapon customization of MW2019 and MW22. Both games put such an emphasis on fine-tuning every aspect of your weapon to suit your playstyle, but the perks are very barebones and restrictive.",Van3oser

Now, when you're ready for the conversation about constructive criticism and not knee-jerk ""this is a ZERO OUTTA TEN!!"" reactions, then perhaps they would have kept Ghosts Superior perk and customisation systems.

It isn‚Äôt just Call of Duty, Fortnite and plenty of other franchises have done so over the years.

And once they figured that it works after testing the waters, they continue to push that envelope to see how much more they can get (e.g. Blackcell ‚Äúpremium battlepass‚Äù)

He was told by Harper and Mason to do whatever was necessary to maintain his undercover identity. When I first heard that, in the back of my mind, I was expecting something like that to happen.

And Menendez being Menendez, was always one step ahead of everyone. He knew Farid was a mole, and he knew that the VTOL that was shot down had Harper in it. He forced Farid's hand, and I just have to believe that Farid really would have shot Harper.

What gets me the most is immediately after he kills Harper, Mason's VTOL comes swinging in, having missed Harper's execution by a matter of seconds. Harper and Farid could have both lived. And the sorrow in Farid's eyes when he tells Mason what he just did. It's haunting.

What I never got is why Menendez didn't kill Farid right then and there when Harper called Farid ""egghead"". I don't know, that would set off some sort of alarm in my head if I were Menendez. That just felt like Harper's way of acknowledging the real Farid and saying goodbye to him in his own way, instead of a soldier facing his death at the hands of a terrorist, getting one last insult out.",Aggravating-Metal167

Modern is boring. The past is boring. Now, I'm not saying we need to go back to wall running, flying in the air, and transforming into robot dogs, but something like BO2 was literal perfection. BO4 attempted to be the successor to BO2, but that Hero Shooter bullshit just ain't it, Chief. Not to mention Treyarch got so fucked on the development time that they only had 24 hours to develop the game (obvious /s, but it did feel like BO4 had next to no development time).

I want **fun** back in COD again. People can sit here and say all they want that nostalgia blinds people to the truth, and to an extent that's true, but I'm still playing the older COD games many, many years after they initially came out and I'm still having fun with them, whereas today's COD games I can barely tolerate 30 mins.

Amazing scrap mechanic to choose which weapons you unlocked and also some really cool weapon designs.

Infinite warfare had really good maps and flow and the movement etc was so good. The only thing I wasn't a massive fan of was the wall running, especially when you could get ridiculously high up on some maps and just run back and forth.

The P-Law was so much fun to use. I love delayed charge sci-fi plasma weapons. Operators were cool, their abilities weren't too irritating. Honestly don't know why everyone hated it. If it hadn't released straight off the back of 2 other sci fi CODs I think it would have been received far better. All in all a pretty solid shooter.

Vanguard was pure cringe and a disgrace of a WWII game, but the gameplay was still pretty fun for the most part. Cold War was just boring. It got better throughout the seasons, but not enough for me to stick around for very long. Modern Warfare was the best for me overall. I liked most of the maps and Ground War was so much fun. Best version of the Gunsmith imo. 

All of these games fail badly with progression. I already really hated the MW progression, but by the time Cold War came out I was just done with it. I felt very rewarded for getting Damascus and (oddly enough) completing the seasonal challenges. After that was all said and done there is really nothing interesting to progress through. This is why I played MW throughout most of the Cold War and Vanguard cycles. Nothing fun enough to work for in those games beyond the insane camo grind that I couldn't be fucked to do again after MW.

CoD's main addiction factor was always amazing easy to pick up and play mechanics paired with a fun progression system to keep you engaged. These newer games just don't have that for me. Also, fuck microtransactons in all of these games. That hurts these games in more ways than one",Onetimeguy8

Cold War - The Movement felt kind of awkward for me. The guns honeslty didnt feel good to use at all. I'm honestly not the biggest fan of Classic 3 lane maps. Okay game just wasnt my vibe.

Vanguard - Was a terrible mess. Map design was terrible. Gun attachments were atrocious and I don't think we need more then 5 attachments. Perks meh. Killstreaks Meh. Id put Vanguard as one of the worse cods easily.

I personally have always leaned more towards infinity Ward but I have friends who are die hard treyarch fans. 

If you liked the OG MW‚Äôs then you‚Äôll probably lean towards Infinity Ward and if you liked the OG BO‚Äôs then you‚Äôll probably lean towards Treyarch. 

It does have to be said though that MW (2019) had basically tied Black ops 1 (2010) in copies sold. This brought a ton of older and newer players back which is why it feels like everyone started playing Cod again around that time. With the introduction of the battle pass and cosmetics their profits skyrocketed. And Modern Warfare 2 (2022) made 1 billion in just 10 days making it the highest selling COD of all time.

Engine was great, most maps were fun (except Euphrates Bridge), and the gunplay was varied. And the campaign was very good. Warzone in this era was great too, as Verdansk is just a great map.

Cold War was not as good of an engine, but it still played pretty good. Fun weapons, good maps that were new and old, and the campaign was great too. Not a Zombies guy, but I know people liked it. It messed with Warzone quite a bit, but at least it was still Verdansk. And we got the great Rebirth Island out of it.

Vanguard is just bad. It changed up things from the MW 2019 engine that didn‚Äôt need to be change, TTK was too quick, and most of the maps were terrible. Gunplay was fine, but not really varied. Heard Zombies was bad, but didn‚Äôt play it. I also didn‚Äôt play the campaign at all. It completely killed regular Warzone for me with Caldera, so I went all in with Rebirth and Fortune‚Äôs Keep and never looked back.",Onetimeguy8

MY RANKING (This is my opinion)

&#x200B;

3.) Vanguard

It's a really bad the game, the spawning sucks and the overall feeling of the game is just bad. I hate the campaign it just felt rushed and that there was no effort put into it. The guns are the only thing that is decent like EX1, Macro, Armaguerra, H4 Blixen,  etc...

&#x200B;

2.) Modern Warfare 2019

This game is just mid because yes the maps were good like Piccadilly or the train one, (forgot the name) it suffered because of the intentional camp spots put into these maps forcing an annoying meta of camping in corners with mp7's and mp5's. Campaign was good though but the final mission was a bit dry.

&#x200B;

1.) Cold War

&#x200B;

Cold War is personally one of my favourite games of the COD franchise because first of all the campaign is so good and there is so many details that Treyarch put in that really shine like the references to burger town, secrets etc. The visuals are great and so is the gunplay in multiplayer. There's Xm4, AK47, mp5, TEC 9 that I enjoy to use and still I sometimes hop on to Cold War to see what's happening.

Very few good maps, gunsmith had no right to be in that game, and the lack of historical information and complete ignorance of history made it the worst CoD to date, and Zombies made it worse. 

Cold War was alright. Campaign was a little short for my liking, but the multiple endings made up for that. Gunsmith was nonsensical in the game, however the game is a net benefit for it. Some of the best zombies since BO3 albeit the maps could have been done better. Multiplayer was busted andOutbreak needed some work, all in all not a bad game.

MW19 was a phenomenal game. An excellent campaign, and a great multiplayer. Spec Ops was a little lackluster and Warzone utterly killed the game.

None of them are perfect but Cold War was probably my favorite. I enjoyed the TTK and I think it had the best variety of maps.

Modern Warfare felt like a great twist on the classic cod formula and I really enjoyed it. It‚Äôs faster TTK isn‚Äôt always my preference but when I‚Äôm in the mood for it, it‚Äôs great. The maps are the only real downside here but even then I think it‚Äôs as bad as some others believe. 

Vanguard is definitely my least favorite out of the three but I‚Äôve still spent tons of time in its multiplayer. Maybe even more than Modern Warfare‚Äôs. I loved its fast pace and slightly longer TTK compared to MW. It had a wide variety of maps though not to many stand out. 

Overall I enjoyed all three of these and have yet to delve into Modern Warfare II. I still have these three downloaded and play and switch between them regularly and am satisfied. Though I do play Cold War the most by a significant margin.",Onetimeguy8

I seriously can‚Äôt put into text what this game did for me. I know a lot of people say that but holy shit man. I have prolly 5000 hours on this game and man, the friendships I made on there have lasted even until this day and age.

My buddy NaterTater14 (Also known as Nate) is my best buddy I‚Äôve met on there. We met on there over 10 years ago and now he‚Äôs like an uncle to my son. We still occasionally talk and play newer games like destiny and rarely cod but it goes to show that not only was the game FUCKING PERFECTION but the atmosphere and people made it even more perfect. 

Mw3 is the best cod EVER and I‚Äôll die on that hill slowly and painfully. Best perk system amazing ttk across EVERY gun and even non meta weapons were still competing especially if you learned your weapon well. Best maps paired with the best game modes (1v1,2v2,3v3) with erosion and aground. Drop zone and infected were introduced along with all or nothing and the likes.

It had so many maps, so many enemy types, AI allies, and just felt good. 

Ghosts Safeguard was too barebones but okay, AW Exo-Survival was alright but too futuristic, BO3 Combat Immersion barely counts as survival since it was more geared to testing loadouts, MW2019‚Äôs could have been great but had too few maps plus MW2019 is a fucked game currently so survival is a bastard to even get into, and MW2‚Äôs Defender mission seems to a be a one-off though it is a decent experience. 

I wish Survival mode became standard like zombies, battle Royale, ground war, campaign, and our typical multiplayer modes so we could have it in far more games instead of once in a blue moon. There is just an awesome feeling of playing as the last soldier(s) in a last stand against an ever-growing force of terrorists, hostile troops, and/or Infected(Ghosts Safeguard had Infected as enemies).",DeadAheadSoldier

Compare it to say a populated city and the city has much more variety in buildings, colours, scales, etc that need to all be done well. Not to mention we are far more used to seeing city landscapes than space so to us of course space will look prettier.

But the problem remains, I have already received 10 checks, I hoped that everything would pass from season 3, but no. I have already written them 5-6 complaints that I have such a problem. they just close the complaint and that's it, they don't even answer anything. I wrote to them to all the emails that are there, there is no answer. They just ignore this fact and make a game for those who don't know how to play it, they don't need the old community! they don't care about us. I made one conclusion. I bought an operative, bought a batelpass, but they don't care, they think that if I am Kazakh and live in Russia, apparently at the moment I have to suffer because of politics and their idiotic prejudices. it's just ridiculous. There is nothing humane in their politics, I am waiting for a new batelfield and I will forget this call of duty like a terrible dream! I'm also streaming this game. They just mock people. I hope that in 10 years the players will understand who they are and declare a baykot, because almost every new released game is raw, they live on the laurels of past games, and have become just impotent in game development, only money, and we don't care, we'll eat shit, because they used to be cool, and now they just mock the players. I like to do killrace, about 20-25 kills, and because of them and their ridiculous expectations, I can't afford it! I hope people will arrange a bike ride and you will understand everything! Although they already fucked up with the game in 100k online! look at apex legends, CS GO, they just give people a chance to play, give an incentive to play to become the best, and their game only causes impotence in the community. If every person I beat in a shootout throws a complaint at me, then I'm automatically on the check, don't you think it's time for you to pay attention to this!",Shake_Annual

* Diego: Side character, does not even matter, stereotypical cartel bad guy #145
* Graves: Ah, finally a good villain in the reboot, this man alone made the game more enjoyable than it should be, he was cold yet charismatic and with good motivations...shame that he fucking dies just because
* Hassan: the fact this man was even alive after he gets captured in Mexico makes 0 fucking sense, boring ass villain of a bad episode of a military show moms watch when Grey's Anatomy ends
* Viktor: .....this man was like a villain for 1 or 2 seasons, did nothing special, died like a common dude
* The Wolf: concept? 10/10, motivations? 10/10, dialogue? 10/10, execution? 0/10, and I am not talking about the VA, the character just does nothing for 80% of the game, is not even the end villain and he dies just like Viktor, like a common nobody
* The Butcher: just like Diego he is just your stereotypical bad guy terrorist #389, he was incredibly bland and boring and serves the purpose of being interrogated
* Valeria: what a joke of a villain, everyone loves her because she is hot, but her backstory and who she is now makes 0 sense, she does nothing all game except make players horny by being mean to them and her plotline with Alejandro is like a bad soap opera
* Barkov: This is the most stereotypical of all the villains, his ""being a bad guy"" is literally just that he is russian, he is russian so obsiously he is a bad guy, he was not the main villain yet ends up being the end villain....for Farah, a side character...
* Hadir Al Asad: the definition of mid, did not even became mid after he was possibly revealed to be Al Asad
* Shepherd: what a joke of a reboot character this is, this man is incredibly stupid, has 0 motivations, is not even like a real villain, he is just a general that fucked it up and now is trying to cover the tracks...respect to the actor but the character was terrible

Overall the MW reboot has some serious issues with villains, plots and characters, but it is specially the lack of remarkable villains the thing that is killing all excitement for where the story is even going, and makes me worried about what Makarov might be turned into",lifeisshortx

Shepard from MW2022 was a total let down. I understand he probably wasn‚Äôt meant to be like his OG counterpart as that would have probably been to predictable but what they should have done was give him a more commanding presence over the enemy soldiers. The OG shadow company seemed like it was Shepards personal unit, his own hit squad that followed his every order without question. They were lethal and don‚Äôt care as long as the mission was done and they got paid. Graves sort of took his place as the commander which makes sense but in turn they left Shepard with nothing.

Shepard was fine but I‚Äôm excited to see what they do with him in the future- I could see his desperation and ruined reputation making him completely unhinged. The rest are a little lackluster.

This MW reboot series has done a fantastic job of creating likable protagonists in 141, Alex, Farah, Nikolai, Alejandro, and Rudi. It‚Äôs no surprise that the best antagonists in the series are closely tied to or were Allies of the protagonists. It‚Äôs led to them being more effective or caring more about them- moreso than someone like Barkov or The Wolf/The Butcher.

Unfortunately, the main a-story antagonists seem to be much less compelling than the black ops series- but these smaller, more personal b-story villains are excellent.",lifeisshortx

Barkov was definitely wicked and there are people like him existing and in charge of some countries sadly. He tortured kids, enslaved a country and just a terrible person all around.


2. Butcher is the classic fanatic, he only cares for the cause and the chaos. Will kill anyone, even the innocents if it benefits AQ beliefs. I do like the contrast of him shitting bricks when Price brings out his own family during the interrogation. 


3. Graves is cool. He was acted well but sometimes he verges on comically evil. But yeah, once again.. he's based on PMCs like Blackwater and there's plenty of soldiers like him who did this stuff.  Although I doubt you could go in killing Mexican army and civilians and then overtaking the base of their special forces just willy nilly.


4. Wolf was the mastermind type character and he did his role pretty well. He didn't stay too long nor did he feel underutilized. The game needed your typical terrorist leader and he fills the role well.


5. Is Hadir confirmed as Al-Assad? I know as a kid, his father called him 'lion' and Al-Assad means the eternal lion but I haven't seen anything official.

Either way, I think Hadir is an interesting character.  He is motivated by rage and rightfully so. He goes the wrong way because he feels they can't beat Barkov otherwise.


6. Valeria.
To be real, most people like her because she's hot. She's not the greatest cartel leader because she loses her lieutenants and gets identified and captured in a span of a single mission. She gets this reputation of being ""the one without a name"" so you'd feel it'd take a bit longer to identify her.


7. Shephard. 
Everyone knows the twist, and well - since Warzone needs to sell skins and no one really dies in this story.. his betrayal does not feel personal. I know it was a mistake to kill Ghost in MW2 but his betrayal cemented Shephard as a classic villain.  
This Shephard spent his entire screen time inside the White House.


8. Viktor Zakhaev gets this spot for the sake of nostalgia, because the reboot did nothing but cut off the whole Zakhaev family story and Imran is already dead - so Viktor simply did not get enough time to branch out. He dies in the same mission he appears in, and he's not even in the main story but spec ops instead. 

9. Diego
Ehh. Just a nothing henchman dude who gets clapped quickly.  He gets a point for saying the funny ""what the fuck kinda name is Soap"" callback.

10. Hassan

If I said Wolf felt adequate as the terrorist leader and filled the role well and didn't overstay his welcome,  Hassan feels the opposite.  His motivation is boring.  His character is bland. There is no investment in killing him and they spent way too much time branching through his story when he should have been just an early story villain and left more space for the Shadows and cartel.

This is just my personal opinion tho.",lifeisshortx

The Wolf was terrifying as he‚Äôs a terrorist with nothing left to lose and the fact that he took absolutely no prisoners even if they beg for mercy

The Butcher was equally as terrifying as The Wolf even if he was killed earlier on. He shot a fucking kid, without second thought, with a .50AE Desert Eagle which fucking hurts

I couldnt get Barkov really. He felt just like some obsessive little shit who killed anyone almost

Hadir was a joke like Valeria and Diego he didnt feel like a threat at all

General Shepherd is terrifying but for a reason not most people would actually care for or even know. Its the fact that everything he did was incredibly realistic to how a legitimate military general would act. Not the old one everyone loved (it was the opposite of what an actual general was supposed to do in the field) but it was how in his office he directed everything.

Multiplayer was and still is my most favorite out of all the games I've played from the CoD franchise. The perk system and weapons were top notch, the DLC maps are amazing (and goofy), the killstreaks are unique (fuck SATCOM) and I liked playing extinction solo.

It was better than mw3 and infinite warfare but it was the dying breath of the franchise under activision. IW has been putting the franchise back on the map again but they are neutered harder than Treyarch was after bo2. I feel this nostalgia is based on a generational fondness of when the average player started playing. If we are going to revisit a great old school game it should be WAW. Don‚Äôt pick something based on when you started playing. The franchise has been around for 20 years and I would rather revisit the original cod and move up the list if I had my way. Two year cycle with a og remastered game in between is what I want.,GamerDabiTodoroki

I'd simply like to see Ghosts performing their original tasks in large scale wars, instead of just being scavengers, stalkers and recon assets who usually didn't do heavy fighting during the years after Odin.

You know, in the trailers they were always portrayed as a badass stealthy CQB unit sabotaging the enemy behind their lines.

- Plentiful places to hide, whether in bushes, weird corners, or just parts of the map that people never checked.

- Huge maps also meant every map had some decent spots for survivors to fight and hold out in.

- Perfect balance of TTK and infected movement speed.

- Callouts were only audible if you were close to the teammate that spotted the enemy, so there were still hints for finding hidden people, but they weren't as ridiculously powerful as in MW2019. 

- Had some ridiculous and fun setups, like goving survivors riot shields and infected sticky grenades.

My personal experience with Ghosts: I enjoyed the campaign it was a nice one.

Extinction was something new as a player that was also playing Zombies it was very weird and odd in the few first matches but after I was coming back to the mode I got the hang of it and it kinda grew into me so it was interesting at best for me.

Now the multiplayer. I got a love and hate experience with this particular one. I loved the whole weapons/attachments/equipment/scorestreaks/perks unlock system. I also liked how could have more than just 3 perks at the time it was definitely a game changer. The movement was perfect for me and the slide that was first introduced in it was the best one yet for me could feel the weight of the character during the whole slide animation it was just perfect. 

The maps were very well made I liked the fact that you could reach and open new places and angles on some maps by blowing up walls and doors with C4s so yeah very well made but also way to big for 6v6 modes. And lastly the TTK, it was one of the fastest that we have ever gotten then and even till today and to be honest having such a fast TTK with this many big maps made people run more from the spawn back to the middle of the map on where most people was rather than having actual gunfights and kills and that's why people resulted on camping more rather than moving around.

So overall my rate on this COD is 7.5/10.",GamerDabiTodoroki

No, leave them in, just stop letting people buy them and remove the weapons. Supply drops used to be a means of letting players who didn't want to pay still get cosmetics, all of my stuff in Advanced Warfare and BO3 came from free supply drops because I don't pay for shit in one-year games.

Now, you have to work for four-five seasons just to earn your first battlepass, which then requires even more grinding, but by that point you're already on the next game. That system is ass for everyone but Warzone players who don't know the difference. Loot boxes only sucked because weapons were locked behind them imo, that system was way better than what we've got today.",StonedPickleG59

Why am I not suprised.  
  
&nbsp;  
Yes, BO4 was eventually a fun game (the last of it's kind), and the store was patched so all guns can be earned by doing in-game contracts, but it wasn't always like that.  
  
&nbsp;  
There was a wave with \#SayNoToBlackOpsPass that got so high and loud the mods of the COD subreddits autoremoved threads about it, and Activision banned the tag on all it's social media outlets.  
  
&nbsp;  
Then Activision put Rob out in front with his perpetuel Soon^T^M and one of the most predatory store fronts until that point, claming they were listening to the community (deja vu huh?).  
  
&nbsp;  
There was no campaign, only 13 maps at launch, and as has since become par for the course content was drip-fed to the community.  
  
&nbsp;  
And here we are just 5 years later and you praise this game.  
  
&nbsp;  
Starting with WWII and it's 9 (nine) maps at launch, Activsion used every COD to test out new predatory means of squeezing money from gamers ... and the playerbase ate it all.  
  
The playerbase taught Activision that it will accept shitty store fronts, nickel & diming and just half the maps of what COD used to launch with, and still spend money on battle passes and funny looking camos.  
  
Heck, the community taught Activsion that SBMM is fine, and waiting 5 minutes to get stomped is not really an issue.  
  
&nbsp;  
Today COD  is more of a money maker than ever. It even spawned a whole subset of youtubers, who do nothing but play COD while whining about it.

As stupid as it may sound given how ""recent"" the game still is, it was a huge improvement in what was otherwise a stagnating franchise. 
New engine, gameplay mechanics and a return to boots on the ground.
The vibe was just there too, a gritty and modern setting with a lot of realism that is emphasized.

Sure it had its fair share of problems, but it was way more than enough to spark some hope into the franchise that I knew and grew up with since I was in my early teens.

Other titles that make me nostalgic is MW (2007) and COD3, as they were my very first violent games.",Buck_de_Luck

By the time black ops 1 came out I started to see that the franchise was getting worse in my opinion. Graphics were choppier, guns were bubblier, maps were less iconic imo. It only got worse as they released more games.

I know this game was disliked by many, but I thought it was great. Campaign was like nothing I'd ever played before. Multiplayer was fun and balanced, and zombies may have been easier than previous installments, but that was my first zombies, and I thought it was so much fun progressing and getting the wonder weapons. My first Call of Duty was MW19, and I didn't buy Cold War until halfway into it's life cycle as I didn't really like the beta, so I hit the ground running with loads of content. I still remember playing MP and zombies with Spotify in the background, sipping on tea while having the time of my life. Nowadays I don't play it much, and I bought the original Black Ops after playing Cold War's campaign, and it was so good I started buying more and more old CODs, I've got like ¬æ of them now.

The thing is that MWR had the whole package I think because the devs/publisher likely anticipated backlash for IW ahead of time. So developing this was a good way to keep momentum going for Activision even if the newest entry wasn‚Äôt doing so hot. Especially since they sold it alongside a special edition for the new COD entry no one wanted to support at the time.

Clearly that worked out for them because their focus shifted towards the multiplayer for MWR having a ton of new content added (lootboxes lmfao) as well as a bunch of changes to the core gameplay. Enough to set itself apart from the original almost completely. They even resold the original DLC. So minimum effort and maximum profit in place of a struggling new entry.

What need would there have been to do the same for MW2R if they already knew MW 2019 was always going to do well?",GamerDabiTodoroki

Without a doubt the best set of maps in a single release of any CoD ever, and as much as people overlook this, this alone is one of the biggest reasons I still play it. Additionally that game came out when the series and community hype peaked and was easily the most addictive multiplayer shooter of the era. These factors resulted in a game having a 5+ year lifecycle when CoD as a business model is dependent on annual sales of new releases that are designed to be attractive enough to generate the immediate sales and to have enough staleness after a while that people will want the next one. Yes, BO and MW3 did very well as subsequent releases, note I did not say this game was a gem in a barren wasteland but rather the best in the era. But many if not a majority of players were dissatisfied with those subsequent releases relative to the holy grail that was mw2. The neglect of the servers and letting hackers run amok was what ultimately killed console mw2 multiplayer. Old school players know the traction that game had, and back then a $60 sale per item was what the creators cared about. The economic climate now with microtransactions and skins (think how Fortnite generates so much revenue as a free-to-play game) makes remastering that game too high of a risk to their bottom line. Warzone is the new focus, obviously the deterioration of CoD multiplayer has coincided with that. As other people pointed out, an additional hurdle is that the newer CoD players don‚Äôt have rose-colored glasses for this entry and they‚Äôre split having to service too many disparate requests/desires that creating a game that isn‚Äôt overloaded with hate is hard  if not impossible to make at this point (without making it so good that it impedes further sales). It‚Äôs a lot like the hospital/pharma analogy where they accidentally cured a disease when they could stand to make a lot more money treating said disease.

TLDR: It was too popular and impacted future game sales to remaster in this day and age.",GamerDabiTodoroki

But my memory is foggy, so I could be wrong. 

But tbh I wasn't a fan of MW2022, and I'm pretty disappointed that they're coming out with an expansion for (even worse made by sledgehammer games, ew.) MW2022 this fall. I would've preferred them to release the MW2R mp unchanged or MW3R (which has been reportedly fully finished for years now yet it hasn't been released) released with a fully remastered version with campaign, survival, and mp included.

Both had multilayer, but people naturally gravitated towards MW, which many people had fond memories from. IW also didn't have the staying power to keep players interested.

10k tomahawk kills and I spent most of my time in SND lobbies getting cross maps. Obviously only a fraction of that were cross maps, maybe 1k of them (no bullshit, I had this down to a science). I was even taking down attack helicopters with tomahawks because it was more efficient than a rocket launcher or SAM. In fact, my proudest kill in CoD history was taking out a chopper on Nuketown to have the tomahawk fall down and kill someone (I‚Äôll link the video if anyone cares to see it). 

Sorry, this video just had me feeling so nostalgic‚Ä¶ this small thing is so impactful on my life as far as gaming goes. I owe a lot of my dopamine rushes as a kid to chucking an axe into the sky.

It‚Äôs between Irons & Hadir

Salazar was there from the beginning, helped Section & Harper with the missions & was a key character in the story but the biggest issue was we didn‚Äôt even see any backstory as to how or why he decided to work with Menendez unless someone can inform me. To me it just looked like he switched sides cause fuck it?‚Ä¶ Meanwhile

Irons was deadass like a step father, especially since his son died so he treated Mitchell like his son since Mitchell & Will were best friends so his hurt more on a personal level especially since he let world power get to him.

Hadir felt like a brother to Alex (he even mentioned him brother) and he was literally Farahs brother so it hurt on more personal levels as well. He let his anger towards Russians get the best of him when the goal of the Urzikstan Liberation Forces was to not use inhumane deadly force like AQ uses so he joined AQ as Khaled Al Asad",Doc-Fives-35581

I liked Hadir but his betrayal didn‚Äôt hurt me and tbh I felt his betrayal was totally justified. Irons I kinda saw coming as it was obvious that he was meant to be the villain and didn‚Äôt really shock me. But Salazar got me man. It hit me hard. Now whenever I play I make sure that Harper survives just so I can see Salazar die. Adlers betrayal in CW hit me but nothing hit me nearly as hard as Graves. When he betrayed me I was hurt for weeks. He truly felt like a brother and a full on member of TF141. The betrayal of the OG Shepherd was always shocking but tbh I like the betrayal of the new Shepard more. I‚Äôve always liked the way the new MW games change up the story from the original MW. I love the OG trilogy but I can‚Äôt deny the MW 2019 and MWII were also very good. They feel way more real and grounded and that‚Äôs what I like about them. But nothing can beat the OG games. MW3 is the best MW game by far with the rest not to far behind.,Doc-Fives-35581

I have enough recent players and people I've added recently who play bo1 alot so I never need to use discord now, only the first time I wanted to find people

And if you're playing on xbox series x you better hope you dont get host, on mw2 if you put a % sign as your clan tag it dissapears when you're host, pay attention to that because it messes with everyone else's connection too

I would only recommend playing bo2 zombies instead of its multiplayer as it's always full even without discord! 

The reason I say only zombies is because hackers are crazy on multiplayer, trust me you dont wanna join those games they can freeze your account and stuff not worth it.

Bo1 hardly ever has hackers because I play HC TDM all the time it's like hackers just leave out that mode even tho it's one of the best and most packed modes on bo1 haha",JerryCat72

* Give the job to Raven, not Treyarch
* Update the reload animations, but don't have them be in the current ""tacticool"" style. Have them be more like animations from the later golden age of COD, like MW2, BO1, MW3, and so on. Those animations have *class*
* Either have the three map packs in the game from day 1 or make them free. Don't resell DLC from well over a decade ago.
* Maybe include some new maps with Americans vs Germans (Pointe du Hoc, St. Marie du Mont, Carentan, etc.) and/or Soviets vs Japanese (Khalkin Gol, Kurill Islands, maybe even Hokkaido, etc.)
* This is definitely gonna get me some flak, but separate the Marine Raider campaign and Red Army campaign. They don't really relate to one another like the two perspectives in COD4 or MW2.

Then there are smaller things that serve as his signature, the pendant, the kneecaping and the fire motif

also his masterplan does not rely on WMDs, that is always a huge bonus

2009 Shepherd is just a next level conspiracy master, it is unbelievable how skillfully he played everyone to achieve what he wanted, and... yes, he won, being killed (in an incredebily badass manner btw) does not mean he lost

The purpleprose dialogue adds a lot of charisma, so does just walking alongside his units on the frontline

His motivation is slighty weaker but he still has some

His plan not only doesn't rely on WMDs (in fact, he had absolutely no idea that a nuke was gonna be used AND EVEN That still ended up playing in his favour - let that sink in) all he needs is a good old deception, false flag op and calculations of unit strenght... btw someone noticed there is a lot of Chess used throughout MW2009, cool

Keep in mind my main focus is multiplayer and especially ranked if a game has it.

Infinity Ward: 

COD4: A classic, catapulted Call of Duty into superstardom in the gaming industry. Not the most balanced or ‚Äúfair‚Äù game but heaps of fun. 

MW2: A top 2 COD game of all time according to most. Negative weapon balance made the game super fun and outrageous. Trickshotting, Private Match mini games (Michael Meyers, Border Control, Dodgeball etc.) This game is pure nostalgia but would still be fun today if it was the active title. Brilliant Maps, Best killstreaks of all time.

MW3: My personal favorite but a step down for most from MW2. Still an outstanding game, super fun Meta (ACR, MP7) Face Off was elite and way ahead of it‚Äôs time for the series (see gunfight a decade later). Not the same level of maps as MW2 but still had a few bangers mixed in with a bunch of decent average maps. (There was also downturn)

Ghosts: Mixed bag of a game. Suffered heavily from some extremely garbage maps but mostly suffered from coming after BO2 and not living up to the expectations. Game was fun for competitive but didn‚Äôt have the same addicting multiplayer loop as years prior. Also extinction was there. 

IW: Didn‚Äôt play multi, heard comp was fun and zombies was cool for a bit but didn‚Äôt sniff Treyarch zombies.

MW19: I am including warzone separately. Lots of people loved this game including some of my closest friends but I personally think it‚Äôs painfully average. The ‚Äúbones‚Äù of the game are outstanding but I could never get over the  horrid map design. Gunfight was LIT and the movement was fun but lightning quick TTK made it feel like the skill gap didn‚Äôt exist. Also a game in 2019 not having any ranked mode especially with its popularity is unforgivable. Also this was the debut of the current ‚ÄúSBMM‚Äù system (I know it existed before but never to this level) This game removed dead silence why exactly?

Warzone: Absolutely lit year 1, still very fun but a noticeable dip in quality year 2, Warzone Caldera year 3

MW22: This game suffers from the same shit as it‚Äôs older brother + some. Horrible maps, boneheaded decisions to remove red dots and the continuation of no DS. That weird ADS delay when jumping, even faster TTK with even less skill gap. This games only saving grace is Treyarchs ranked mode which is actually quite fun.

Warzone 2: Played a bunch on release, it sucked ass then, i‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs even worse now, need I say more?

Treyarch:

WAW: Fun game, MP40 was ridiculous and not in the fun MW2 ‚Äúeverything is crazy‚Äù type way. Maps were dark and grubby but the flow was extremely nice so I overlooked it. Some of the wonkiest perks in history. Introduction of Zombies gave me some outstanding memories on Nacht

BO1: Wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea, I stuck with MW2 but when I did play the game I did enjoy it. Party mode games were awesome, the in game currency system worked decently well and the campaign was a massive W

BO2: The king, CODs peak, Near perfect multiplayer, Ranked mode, trickshotting, Trolling, youtube content, party games Pick 10 system, there‚Äôs not much about this game that hasn‚Äôt been said but i think most would agree that this was the shiny top of the golden era of the game. Zombies was nearly killed here but ended the year with MOTD and Origins which were outstanding.

BO3: Multi was fun, good ranked mode, solid guns, continuation of the Pick 10 system, beautiful colorful maps, definition of a Very Good game but specialists held it back from being a top tier game IMO. The speedrunning mode still sticks around in my head for some reason and Zombies was S tier.

BO4: Another game that isn‚Äôt the best but I loved. High TTK and Skill gap basically carried for me. Movement was fun too but the maps were forgettable and specialists were even more busted. Zombies dropped the ball and the game didn‚Äôt even have a campaign if I remember correctly. Also auto healing was kinda wack even though I was nasty at the game

Cold War: Decent, decent ranked mode, decent maps, decent guns, higher TTK so an actual skill gap. Decent zombies, decent campaign etc. Game was just decent but being surrounded by stinkers has helped it look way better.

SHG/Raven: 

MW3: They were both on MW3 so they get the same credit as IW

AW: Most underrated game in the franchise. It was like setting a firework off in your grandmas basement. Not good but so much fun. If this game didn‚Äôt have supply drops with PTW aspects it would be much higher rated. The most fun multiplayer for a jet pack game.

MWR: It‚Äôs cod 4 but every aspect is slightly worse. Definition of Mid

Cod Online: Yeah Raven developed this, shocking right? Game is a ton of fun and is what COD should be doing for a future title but since it‚Äôs Chinese most people haven‚Äôt played it.

WW2: Game was ass until the overhaul update and then it was slightly less bad after that update. Super forgettable to the point that I‚Äôm sure i‚Äôm forgetting something right now. Campaign was gorgeous though.

Sledgehammer also has credit for assisting on MW19 and Cold War which isn‚Äôt doing anything to help their resume. 

Vanguard: Easily the worst COD game of all time and I don‚Äôt even have to explain why because it dropped last year so it‚Äôs still fresh in everyone‚Äôs mind.


In terms of OVERALL production Treyarch is clear. They‚Äôre not all S tier but even in their bad years the game is tolerable if not decent. IW had that 3 game stretch at the end of the 2000s into the 2010s that was a higher peak but in terms of overall quality it‚Äôs gotta be 3arc",starosexx

Jokes aside Treyarch indeed has everything better aside of graphics and fluidity in their movement and animations, you know useless crap like that. They have better campaigns, better characters, better multiplayer, better game design, better maps, better communication, the best third game mode, and take in to account that you can throw new directions, projects or modes into this mofos to make in 1 year, 6 months or 3 months and it somehow is the highlight of those games, IW had 3 years for MWII and they fumbled it just like they did for their last 4 games and SHG did like a half decent game in AW and nothing more.

 There is basically nothing I would miss from Infinity Ward or Sledgehammer outside of like Yuri and Makarov, and yeah those 2, I would not miss Price, or Soap or Ghost cause if I am being honest, they are a bit overrated as characters, and Sledgehammer well.....they had some cool maps in AW I guess? 

All in all I still think one year CoDs could work if we removed IW and SHG from the equation and instead had Raven and High Moon replacing them. Nonetheless for a 3 year game, I would definitely go with Treyarch.",starosexx

Treyarch hasn't had a full development cycle for any game since BO3 I believe, and they've all been good. CW is questionable, but it's my favorite of the last 4. BO4 I really enjoyed, it's even fun to go back to now. BO1 is S tier, most of the community agrees BO2 is as well and I love W@W. BO3 is the most questionable game but I know the Zombies community likes it. Give them enough time to design something great and they will, in my opinion Infinity Ward hasn't since MW3. 

Score: 4.5/6 (W@W, BO1, BO2, BO4, half credit for CW)

SHG I think gets unfairly shit upon, though I will mention Vanguard. WW2 was rough at launch but it is pretty good now(and to be fair wasn't CW similar in that regard), Advanced Warfare is my favorite jetpack CoD and MW3 was made partially by SHG so they deserve credit. 

Score: 2/3.5 (AW, half credit for WW2 and MW3)

Infinity Ward has been meh at best for a while now. MW22 turned me off pretty much immediately. MW2019 was frustrating. I hate Infinite Warfare(it's probably my least favorite CoD). Ghosts is good but not great. MW3 I love, but only half credit for this. MW2 is obviously great. I missed MW1 at the time so I don't have that nostalgia for it. 

Score: 3/6.5 (MW1, MW2, half credit for MW3 and Ghosts)

Even if you want to look at it like which developer made the worst game, I'd take any Treyarch game over Infinite Warfare or Vanguard. Hell I'd take any Treyarch game over any Infinity Ward CoD since Ghost.",starosexx

MW2 has issues, mainly for me, it's the bugs, and the minimaps ass. I dont find the perk system to be much of an issue anymore, although they may as well remove the whole charge mechanic at this point. Even if they just fix the bugs, i think MW2 will honestly be the best CoD has ever been for me, as while some of the other issues are annoying, they dont bother me as much.

I didn't get the opportunity to play some of the older Treyarch (or CoD in general) multiplayer experiences as i didn't have internet back then. Black Ops 3 and Cold War MP didn't really hook me at all, and Zombies didn't really interest me until Outbreak came around.

The CoD games I've enjoyed the most were MW2019 and MW2 (2022). MW2 has been a step backwards in some ways, but a step forward in others. The main thing i would change about IW themselves would be them sometimes listening to the community, specifically about issues like the perk system (which i think is in a decent place) and the minimap. It's a fine line as you can't please everyone, and sometimes any communities ideas on changes for a game are absolute dogshit.

Also, im probably in the minority on this, but i like the goofy ass skins in these modern CoD games.",starosexx

Now it depends on what you want out of the campaign, you want fun gameplay and scenarios? Or perhaps a great story? Maybe something that makes you feel like you are a soldier? Without a doubt the best campaign IMO being completely subjective is World At War, it is a masterpiece of a campaign despite the big movement and level restrictions, everything from music, voice acting, setting, gameplay, story, is just a 10 out of 10, however I recommend playing World At War, BO1, BO2 and CW in that order if you want the best campaign saga of the series. I will leave you with a list of ratings for each campaign since CoD4:

CoD4: 7/10, good, but not that good

WaW: 10/10, the perfect campaign

MW2: 8.5/10, for some the best campaign because of the twists, but it lacks the WaW effect

BO1: 9/10 amazing story full of mystery, great sequel to a great game

MW3: 8.5/10 amazing conclusion to a story, my personal favourite of the trilogy

BO2: 9.5/10, best overarching story, best villain and definitely the best in gameplay

Ghosts: 8/10, great villain, weird setting but it was enjoyable

AW: 6/10, has some good missions and a good villain

BO3: 3/10, they should have kept their original story, it is fun to beat it for gameplay, but that is it

IW: 4/10, bad characters, bad plot, and people praise its gameplay....its just BO2 gameplay with jetpacks

WW2: 4/10, boring, that's it, is just boring

BO4: -------

MW 2019: 6/10, boring, bad villains and characters, bad third act but overall, an improvement

CW: 8.5/10 great story, great settings, and has the ultimate Chad, Russel Adler

Vanguard: 1/10, by far the worst campaign, has 2 missions worth of story, do not play this

MWII: 5/10, solid first act with great missions, falls flat in the other 2, terrible villains and again, a terrible third act

So that's it, hope you enjoy some of them if you decide to go through them, if you do, play WaW, BO1, BO2, CW in that order, then CoD4, MW2, MW3, and then you can play Ghosts, AW, IW, and MW 2019 & MWII in any order really",Archaeopteryx108

If you have access to a PS3, PC, or Xbox (360, One, or Series X|S all have access), there's an entire golden age of campaigns to play. CoD 4, MW2, MW3 in that order, and World at War, Black Ops, and Black Ops 2. Those are the two main stories from back in the day that people know and love.

Otherwise, you're locked out of pretty much any full story in regards to those games. CoD4 and MW2 have remasters, but MW3 doesn't and neither does any other game. You've got Black Ops 3, but Black Ops 4 doesn't even have a campaign and Black Ops Cold War is more related to the BO2 and below games. This basically leaves you with Advanced Warfare, Infinite Warfare, and the two most recent Modern Warfare games (2019 and 2022), which I don't think you'll be disappointed with, though the community isn't necessarily obsessed with them.",Archaeopteryx108

Why does Black Ops III on Steam have more players than every other game combined? [COD],https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/12awt3w/why_does_black_ops_iii_on_steam_have_more_players/,Huntsmanbravo,"Steam Charts is not an accurate representation of the active player base for CoD games.  It is only counting the number of people who currently have the game open through Steam.  It is not counting the total number of players in public matchmaking.  For MW (2019), BOCW, Vanguard, and MWII (2022), the player counts listed on Steam Charts are significantly smaller than the actual player counts as they were also released on Battle.net on PC and have cross platform support.  For MW (2019), BOCW, and Vanguard, this impacts Steam Charts representation of them even more heavily as they were originally released only on Battle.net for PC and only recently released on Steam, meaning the overwhelming majority of the PC player base for them is on Battle.net, which is not tracked by Steam Charts.  For BO3, while it does have a higher concurrent player count than the non-cross platform CoD games on Steam, public matchmaking for it is not much better.  BO3‚Äôs player base tends to consist of zombies players who stick to private lobbies.  Thanks to mod support and more official zombies maps than every CoD game except BOCW, it tends to attract zombies players more than most other CoD games on Steam.",TheNewFlisker

BO2 exactly as we saw it, both 1980's & 2025 portions? No longer truly canon. 

Sure, some elements of it are still present like the Menendez Cartel and likely the 1980's portion still mostly happens the same - but the 2025 portion isn't truly canon anymore. There are too many things that would have to change in 2 years for that to happen. (and obviously BO2 zombies is also no longer canon)

However, the whole of BO2 is technically still canon if you consider COD Vanguard's ending to be canon - in which case BO2 existed as part of the previous Black Ops timelines from WaW-BO4 in both campaign and zombies before Tag der Toten reset the multiverse, keeping WaW and Bo1 canon whilst largely purging the rest (hence why every game since BO4 has been in a new unified timeline). 

Despite this however a version of BO2 is still probably going to happen, just not the exact one we saw. 

Of course, if you ignore the MW Reboot connection then BOCW and BO2 could still be in the same canon timeline as they don't really conflict with one another.",Racist_carbonara

it still has an amazing multiplayer with lots of remade maps from the Black Ops franchise such as:

**BO1:** Nuketown, Jungle, WMD, Drive-In (BO1 DLC) and Zoo (although slightly different layout-wise, and also a DLC)

**BO2:** Express, Stand-off, Hijacked, Raid, Slums and Rush (BO2 DLC)

The MW series & the Black ops series. since you‚Äôre a sucker for nice graphics i‚Äôd say start off with the MW reboot series which consists of MW2019 & the new MW2. however during both campaigns both of them have references & easter eggs to the original MW series that you‚Äôll miss (Cod 4, of MW2 & MW3). You don‚Äôt *have* to get the original series but since that‚Äôs where the cod franchise really took off then it is nice to start off from there to get some details & references that the reboot games show 

for the black ops series, unfortunately their best games are the ones with the older graphics so you‚Äôll have to play them. start off with World at war as the russian campaign have 2 characters that continue into bo1. then from there play bocw as even tho it‚Äôs a newer game it actually takes place directly after bo1. then play bo2 then bo3. bo4 doesn‚Äôt have a campaign

For the other cod games i‚Äôd recommend still playing them to experience them. they‚Äôre basically all in their own universes (cod ghosts, Advanced warfare, ww2, vanguard, infinite warfare) and most are nice tbh


For multiplayer honesty just play the new MW2, it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs being currently updated & it would have the most support. MW2019, Cold wat & Vanguard still have active lobbies but since you‚Äôre new to the series i‚Äôd suggest playing the new MW2",mrknoot

Before purchasing one, I would recommend installing and trying Warzone 2.0 as it is free to play and shares its core gameplay mechanics with MW (2019), Vanguard, and MWII (2022).

"[COD] I Mean, just how bad can COD be?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/12g1ozl/cod_i_mean_just_how_bad_can_cod_be/,WULFENMARK,"MWII feels like a generic shooter. Gunplay is great but aim speed is too low as it is mobility, making playing unsatisfactory and boring (cant feel the flow while moving through maps). It is basically a lazy attempt of making an enriched cosmetic bundle shopping simulator. Lost hope for COD til 2024 honestly.

 Totally agree with your post except for:
- MW2019 was great improvement in terms of graphics, gunplay and mobility (except for slide ""cancer""). Mobility was improved again with Vanguard. At least for me VG mobility is the best and most pleasant mobility seen on COD. VG Zombies were a joke... but has the best MP after BO4. I had fun as hell for its agility and (not general opinion) love how they designed maps under the WWII setting. I find them beatiful. Maybe slightly fast TTK but now im playing VG MP instead of that thing called MWII.


- CW was pretty solid. Amazing art style. SBMM was too high. Campaign was nice. MP maps were more complex and bigger than classic maps but 35% were nice and thats a lot nowadays. Low quantity of round based Zombies maps, but Onslaught was great introducing open world Zombies. I love Treyarch decided to innovate that way. I love round based Zombies (I play Zombies since WaW), but I always missed wide paths or more open areas as seen on BO3 Steam Workshop community made maps. Thats why I dont like Killing Floor 2 unmodded maps as well.",NonCha1antly

I mean, if you didn't like MW19, I don't understand why you thought you'd like MW22. People say ""Infinity Ward is the worst CoD dev"" for a reason, and for a while I thought they were exaggerating because I *did* like MW19, but it turns out it's just the truth. Since all the core team left to go form Respawn and make Titanfall, they really have only made a single game on their own that I enjoyed, and they immediately lost that with MWII.

The way I see it these days, Treyarch is the only CoD dev making classic, decent CoDs. Sledgehammer games could be good too, but they're always riding Infinity Ward's coattails instead of doing their own thing, and Activision's terrible scheduling decisions gave us the buggy mess that was Vanguard and what will assuredly be a buggy mess this year.",NonCha1antly

first sign out of your ps3 account. 
then go into the game and click lan party multiplayer. 
create and join a random match it doesnt matter what the settings are. once you join the match leave right after.
go into the online multiplayer it will ask you to sign in.
then it will sign you in and you will be in multiplayer but just so u know every time u load the game you have to repeat these annoying steps.

Of the four games, MWII (2022) is the only one receiving content updates.  Before purchasing one, I would recommend installing and trying Warzone 2.0 as it is free to play and shares its core gameplay mechanics with MW (2019), Vanguard, and MWII (2022).  If you enjoy it, you‚Äôll likely enjoy one of those three games.  If not, you‚Äôll likely enjoy BOCW more.  

If you are interested in the plot, there are two main timelines.  The Modern Warfare timeline consists of CoD4, MW2 (2009), and MW3.  The Black Ops timeline consists of WAW, WW2, Vanguard, BO1, BOCW, MW (2019), MWII (2022), BO2, BO4, and BO3.  There is also the original CoD trilogy, which consists of CoD1-3 and may be a part of either major timeline or its own independent timeline.

This can be a bit tricky, so here are a few things you can try:  
  
**Make sure all the controllers are synced and signed in:** Before starting the game, make sure that all the controllers you'll be using are synced and signed in to your Xbox One. You can do this by pressing the Xbox button on each controller and making sure it shows up on the screen.  
  
**Check your account settings:** Sometimes, account settings can cause issues with split-screen play. Make sure that your account is set as the primary account on your Xbox One, and that you've set up a guest account for each additional player.  
  
**Try a hard reset:** Sometimes, simply resetting your Xbox One can help resolve issues like this. Try unplugging the console and waiting a few minutes before plugging it back in and turning it on again.  
  
**Contact Xbox support:** If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact Xbox support for additional help. They may be able to assist you in resolving the issue and getting 4-way split-screen working properly.

It really felt like a quality mess with spotty hit detection, somewhat unbalanced weapons (OP MP40, weak shotguns), the frustrating mix between juggernaut/stopping power users and the Zombies mode isn‚Äôt better with the wunderwaffe taking jog off, melee not always consistent and other issues arise. Tho I have to give credit for the fantastic maps and one of the best feeling weapons in the series.

For MW3. It just felt like something we all wanted in MW2. People like to bash MW3 for being a reskin but for me, that‚Äôs what I like about it. A more balanced MW2 with a ton more variety. You had specialist streaks, proficiency‚Äôs incase a weapon sucks at one stat (think of range or recoil) and you were able to mitigate it, first iteration of scorestreaks, No noobtubes/commando/one man army and weapon variety is somewhat there, I were able to use weapon alternatives to the dominate ACR/MP7 such as the Scar, PP90M1, Type 25, FAD, G36C. Underrated weapons that are almost on par on those two weapons. The spec ops is the best we had in the serie. The survival game mode was an addicting addition and a nice refresh from zombies and the campaign had one of the most significant set pieces and the most satisfying conclusion to a trilogy and definitely the best game for anyone wanting a WW3 experience",Zer0Sum12

Personally MW3.

The MP was far better than WaW's, mainly because of the weapon balance and variety.

WaW does have a better campaign and zombies but WaW zombies is pretty barebones, especially without DLC, so spec ops survival can somewhat rival it.",Zer0Sum12

Both players spawn as prisoners in different locations, but only one of them gets the opportunity to free himself. After that there‚Äôs a few QTE‚Äôs mixed with with fighting street to street and some breaching sequences. 

It was very unusual for a Spec Ops mission. But then again it was in a DLC pack. I would rate it 10/10 and I plan on buying the rest of the DLC.  It sucks that the quality of Spec Ops missions has dropped over the years but ehh I guess that‚Äôs just how it is.",MotvUnknown

[COD] Rank this campaigns,https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/12nayl8/cod_rank_this_campaigns/,adamircz,"Cold War is just fantastic overall, solid level design, atmosphere is top notch, great plot and characters, even the soundtrack is great, couldn't recommend more

Downsides being, its the shortest one in the whole series and the audiovisials are slighty outdated

MW2022 has some really amazing missions, in fact this is probably the most creative they have ever been, it's also got great cast of characters, gunplay and audiovisuals one step ahead of the entire industry and its the longest one since CoD2

Downsides are: 

- Plot is extremely lame and uninteresting

- Although the individual missions are amazing, there is something off about the way they follow one into another, which makes for pretty sloppy pacing

- The enemies wearing armour are way too overused

- Poor usage of soundtrack, the author of it even resigned because her work wasn't used well

- It feels like they couldn't quite decide whether they wanna go in a realistic direction like MW2019 and CoD4 or whether they wanna do the Hollywood Action like MW2&3, there is some tonal inconsistency, which overall doesn't make it very epic or satisfing

MW2019 is the most realistic and immersive CoD's ever been, audiovisuals and gunplay are great, characters are great, Cleanhouse, Wolf's Den and Into the Dark are just amazing missions, they still stuck to the dual perspective between Special Forces and Rebels, and the child mission for the first time playthrough... just when I thought nothing in gaming can hit me too hard anymore, that happens

Then there are some mixed bag aspects:

- Plot has some nice moments and a good structure, but overall its just another WMD centered terrorist hunt

- Some of the more ordinary sections have really good design, others have an infuriating cutscenefest/interactive movie pacing; the devs just sometimes forget that they are making a game

And the bad stuff:

- Too short

- Poor soundtrack usage

- Very anticlimatic ending",Vibing_Pug

Of the four games, MWII (2022) is the only one receiving content updates.  Before purchasing one, I would recommend installing and trying Warzone 2.0 as it is free to play and shares its core gameplay mechanics with MW (2019), Vanguard, and MWII (2022).  If you enjoy it, you‚Äôll likely enjoy one of those three games.  If not, you‚Äôll likely enjoy BOCW more.  All other CoD games released on Steam suffer from low player counts.  Depending on game, region, and time of day, it may be possible to find lobbies of Core TDM but anything beyond that is unlikely.  For several of the games, player counts are so low that it is no longer possible to find lobbies through public online matchmaking.  Additionally, all CoD games released on Steam prior to BO3 suffer from security vulnerabilities that allow other players to remotely access and control your PC while playing online.

If you are interested in the plot, there are two main timelines.  The Modern Warfare timeline consists of CoD4, MW2 (2009), and MW3.  The Black Ops timeline consists of WAW, WW2, Vanguard, BO1, BOCW, MW (2019), MWII (2022), BO2, BO4, and BO3.

Which Call Of Duty Game Should I Buy [COD],https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/125n0wn/which_call_of_duty_game_should_i_buy_cod/,Specific-Passion7090,"Depends on what you‚Äôre more interested in. If you‚Äôre looking for multiplayer experience, go with MW2 2022, as it‚Äôs the most played nowadays.

If you plan on playing campaign, it also depends on what kind of story you enjoy most.

The Modem Warfare series (both original and reboot) is more action packed, and it‚Äôs the closest to actual modern day conflict in terms of story and themes.

The Black Ops series has a darker, more serious tone. BO1 and BO: Cold War is set between the late 60‚Äôs - early 80‚Äôs, while BO2 and 3 are set (mostly) in the near/far future. BO4 doesn‚Äôt really have a story at all.

Other futuristic COD games are Advanced Warfare and Infinite Warfare.

Personally, I‚Äôd recommend the Black Ops Series. If you plan on following the whole storyline than you should play WaW, BO1, BO:CW, BO2 and BO3 in that order. But it‚Äôs really up to you, every game is worth playing on it‚Äôs own merit.",ExpensiveEmployer230

First off, some basic knowledge: there are two major subseries in COD, named Modern Warfare and Black Ops. MW games are primarily developed by Infinity Ward, and BO by Treyarch. There are also other dev teams working on COD, such as Sledgehammer Games, who made some standalone titles such as Advanced Warfare, WWII and Vanguard; and Raven Software, who is usually a support team for all of the COD titles, while also leading development of Warzone.

If you just want to jump into 6v6 Multiplayer, Modern Warfare II is the latest game available, and by default the one with the biggest player count. There are at least three older CODs (Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War, Vanguard) that have crossplay support, meaning you can play with others from consoles, and those games are still fairly active, but every other COD before those doesn't, so the playerbase for those games is kinda nonexistent for multiplayer. MWII is also attached to Warzone 2.0, which is the latest iteration of battle royale, so you're getting a 2-in-1 package here.

For Zombies, you'd want to look into the Black Ops games in particular, as Zombies is a staple game mode for that series. There are other CODs made by other dev teams that also feature Zombies, but Black Ops is the birthplace of that game mode, so that's really where you wanna go for. I recommend looking into Cold War, as it is the latest one for a good Zombies experience that is also catered toward more casual players. Vanguard also features a Zombies mode that is developed by Treyarch in collaboration with SHG, and is a prequel to Cold War's Zombies story, though its gameplay system is not in the same traditional style as other Zombies modes, and is admittedly less varied compared to CW.",Santa_Claus77

Reason is it‚Äôs the current cod and it‚Äôll get updated as time goes on and it has the biggest playerbase currently. However other options are MW2019, BOCW & Vanguard as they have crossplay & are still active. But any cod before that you‚Äôll find lobbies but at a significantly lower rate, like it‚Äôs hard to find lobbies 

As for zombies, Bo3 is your best bet especially if you‚Äôre on PC for mods but another option is BOCW, it‚Äôs the latest zombies game that‚Äôs well received and since it‚Äôs cross platform, lobbies are easier to find. DO NOT GET VANGUARD FOR ZOMBIES

For battle royale Warzone 2.0 is in the same situation as the new MW2, it‚Äôs the newest cod BR game & it‚Äôs still getting updates alongside MW2. It also has another mode called DMZ where it‚Äôs cods take on Escape from Tarkov if you‚Äôre interested. Warzone 1 won‚Äôt be getting major updates anymore but you can always try it out since it‚Äôs free (just like Warzone 2.0) & it has a lot more weapons than warzone 2 (it has weapons from MW2019, BOCW and Vanguard while warzone 2 only has MW2 weapons)",Santa_Claus77

Put simply,  games are optimised better for pc. Switch between a console only match to a crossplay one and you'll notice a big difference.  Console only matches play just right.  Hit reg is good,  input lag is just right,  but jump in a pc lobby when on console and there's a big difference which makes every pc player seem like a god. Kill cams prove this... they see you first, shoot you first,  can hit you when you're clearly behind cover... but you don't see any of this in your screen, despite playing on a 1ms input lag monitor. It's why so many pc players are now playing on controller and dominating - they get the aa advantage without the disadvantages of poor optimisation if they were in a console.  Taking aa and controller vs mkb arguments out of the equation, and what you're left with is crossplay just being cancerous to console players. It bewilders me why as console players  we accept this and continue to buy games with forced pc crossplay,  including input based crossplay. A pc player using a controller still has so many advantages over a console player it's ridiculous.",Lunacy_Phoenix

AA in MW2 is insane, pro players talk about it, content creators talk about it, why do you think a lot of the big content creators switched to controller? Why do you think the ranked leaderboards are like 99% controller players? Because the game is so insanely unbalanced in favour of controller players, because that‚Äôs where the money is on the casual tommy no thumbs, so they can play 10mins a night, get a win, spend some money‚Ä¶.
Cod is not a competitive shooter, it‚Äôs why the pro scene isn‚Äôt taken seriously outside of NA.

I‚Äôm the total opposite player to you, I‚Äôve played mnk for the last 15 years rarely using a controller unless it‚Äôs a race game, I plugged in my controller a few weeks ago to see how strong it was, I was scoped in on a sniper watching a gap I‚Äôd seen someone move to the side of, the guy leapt across the gap, I didn‚Äôt touch the stick and it traced and followed him pixel perfect. That‚Äôs the problem with AA, it tracks perfectly and instantaneously, and that‚Äôs simply not how mnk is at all, mnk takes actual skill to get the flicks right and the movement right, on a controller you literally look in the right direction and ADS and it traces people, that‚Äôs the complaint of mnk players that being good on controller isn‚Äôt hard because it‚Äôs not supposed to be, there‚Äôs little training required.
The difference in lobbies since Cronus and Xims got banned is massive though and something I applaud, being good at an FPS game, should require time and skill, playing 10mins a night you should be getting punished and not have the game carry you (2 bullet leg kills vs 6 upper torso shots with the same game and losing the gun fight‚Ä¶)",Lunacy_Phoenix

I'm sure I also could get some kills if I turned off aim-assist. That doesn't disprove anything when its literally a fact that having aim-assist on is superior to not having it on.

Then we have the weird cases of BO3 and BO4, both of this games could possibly get retconned in the future, for the moment, they are not canon and are in a different timeline where the MW 2019 and MWII events do not happen.

Then we have the Warzone timeline, this timeline is non canon as of Vanguard, but elements of this timeline are indeed canon, for example the events that took place in Verdansk in 2020 when Zakhaev's son dies. Adler killing Stitch is also a canon event, but things like Caldera are non canon.

Then there is the zombies timeline, of which you only need to know that WaW, BO1, BO2, BO3, half of BO4, BOCW and Vanguard are canon to the storyline. IW, WWII, and the Chaos storyline are not canon to the Aether timeline. Exctinction is canon to itself only.",skippiskip

Think of it as an introduction to the Zombies mode, especially if you're used to playing multiplayer.  That's how I got my kids into Zombies and they liked it so much that they took the plunge into older Zombies games, which are all more on the challenging side since they lack mechanics such as mantling and there's no mini-map.  Plus easter eggs in Cold War are more straightforward while old school Zombies have less obvious steps.  But that's just my two cents as someone who plays a lot of campaign/multiplayer and doesn't mind easter eggs having an objective-based vibe.

[COD] the problem I have with the CoD Fanbase the community and the competitive scene and why it's killing the franchise,https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/120yllq/cod_the_problem_i_have_with_the_cod_fanbase_the/,bvckspaced,"if anything the hyper-casual community being the only demographic their design choices appeal to is killing the game. They haven‚Äôt cared about the competitive community in years, evident by how ubiquitously hated the most recent installments (minus Treyarch-made titles) have been by said community due to the devs flat out not listening to any feedback.

The competitive community are also the biggest proponents against SBMM/EOMM so I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre blaming them. If anything, blame the lack of skill gap in recent cods (over-tuned AA, no dead silence, fast ttk) for making SBMM unenjoyable. Treyarch designing ranked play is the only saving grace this game has, and not even they can fix the antiquated design choices instilled by the dev team at IW that is on record saying they hate the competitive community",Paulkdragon

>but with how strict the matchmaking is regardless of what you call it, you‚Äôll never have that room to grow 

I‚Äôd disagree, SBMM allows people to learn since it‚Äôll place them with people of similar skill, if you‚Äôre still trying to figure out how things work, you‚Äôre most likely going to be placed with others who are in the same situation, giving you more room to experiment since you won‚Äôt be as harshly punished 

From my experience of playing other games where you‚Äôre new and going up against experienced players, you don‚Äôt get same opportunity since anything you try gets easily countered but you can‚Äôt try out those same strategies since you get destroyed quickly and making mistakes is much less forgiving, and it‚Äôs usually when I see people resorting to cheap tactics like camping or abusing mechanics

Edit: 

Although I will say I do think the competitive community is part of the reason the games aren‚Äôt as enjoyable as they are now, but not necessarily for the reasons people mention 

Games in general feel sweatier nowadays, especially since gaming has had more time to grow and with platforms like YouTube and Twitch making it easier to access knowledge, everybody is play ‚Äúvery competitively‚Äù because they want to be the best at the game 

While YouTube existed back then, gaming and YouTube weren‚Äôt as big and figuring stuff out was a lot more of trial and error, however nowadays you can learn the stats and best attachments within hours of a new weapon releasing",Paulkdragon

i play mostly for fun and to vibe out after work and even though i enjoy the game it does feel off like i want to have fun and get kills but i want it to be a challenge i dont think sbm in itself is bad i think the way it is executed is.

[BO3] what‚Äôs the canon order for the campaign?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/120c1jx/bo3_whats_the_canon_order_for_the_campaign/,RdJokr1993,"You weren't ""imagining"" the story. It was a simulation made by Corvus to keep your consciousness alive while you reside in Taylor's brain.

Yes, you read that right. During the operation that was supposed to help save your life, Taylor interfered and used his DNI to connect with you when complications arose. Corvus saw it as an opportunity to ""download"" you into Taylor's brain, thus allowing it to construct a simulation based on Taylor's memory.

In the simulation, Taylor and his team replace four other Winslow Accord agents: Stone, Ramirez, Conrad, and Fierro, all of whom were Taylor and Hendricks' allies. Aside from having cybernetics involved, the simulation remains faithful to Taylor's memory up to where Hendricks kills Taylor/Stone. At that point, the simulation starts to break down as a different set of events unfold in reality.

Due to Corvus' infectious nature within the DNI, it wasn't just the Player reliving Taylor's memories, but everyone else was also pulled in via their DNI connection, forced to play out their roles. So when they ""died"" in the simulation, they also die IRL. By the end, where Taylor ""dies"", the simulation stops as the Player takes over. The final mission, Life, actually takes place in the real world up until the Player attempts suicide. At that point, they are pulled into another simulation, where Corvus keeps all of its victims' consciousness. Hence why you actually meet Taylor again, who helps you fight Corvus and gain control.",Connect-Internal

[COD] What would y‚Äôall want to see from devs in a new call of duty game to make it actually fun?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/11w7kzh/cod_what_would_yall_want_to_see_from_devs_in_a/,Beneficial_Pace_7681,"Everyone's #1: sbmm
2: ghost and dead silence being the entire game
3: put jug back in zombies and do not have a tortoise perk(if there is tortoise there needs to be gauntlet challenges, otherwise it's too easy to get high rounds and it gets stale fast) They've made it clear the easter eggs aren't going to be hard anymore but as long as there is some sort of challenge per map I'd be satisfied.
4: basic 3 lane maps with no doors, boards, or any 'next gen' bs. This franchise made its mark as an ARCADE shooter.
5: lobby retention after each game
5.5: map vote or veto ability
6: more priority to multi-player over warzone. I pay $70 to play multi-player. You don't pay shit to play warzone. I *should* get better dev response.

And last 7: if you're going to name a game after a game you already released. Put some of the maps from said game into the game. Not just maps that fit your sentinel players.",JH_c_of_d

[COD] Best Call of Duty Tournament Phase 1 Round 1: VG vs WW2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/12nosea/cod_best_call_of_duty_tournament_phase_1_round_1/,shrimpmaster0982,"For a randomized match up this one worked out pretty well. Vanguard imo has a lot of flaws, mainly pertaining to its campaign and zombies, whereas I can only really describe WW2 as average. It doesn't do a whole lot very well and, after some major patches and reworks of the MP, it doesn't do a whole lot wrong either. Sure WW2 has a bland, unmemorable and unremarkable story, but at least I don't actively dislike it like I do Vanguard (and really I only dislike that Vanguard felt really unfocused, it told a lot of small stories without ever really integrating them properly and then it just sprinted full speed ahead to a conclusion I couldn't have cared less about). Sure Vanguard had probably a slightly better MP as it, to me at least, felt pretty much just like a slightly updated and reskined MW2019 clone and I liked MW2019 (it's nowhere near my favorite in the franchise, but I sunk waaaaayyy too much time into that game to claim I hated it), but WW2 doesn't have a bad MP and with Vanguard having thrown in a literal laser rifle and modern assault rifle into the game at the very end I can't say it didn't jump a series of sharks. Sure WW2 has one of the most average possible zombies in existence, like all the maps are okay but none really stand out particularly well and quite frankly I don't remember shit about the story beyond the fact it had David Tenent and Electra (the chick from Daredevil) in it. But none of that matters when the competition is Vanguard zombies, which failed in almost every way as a zombies game and kind of genuinely hurts me as a long time fan of the mode who absolutely loved the new direction things seemed to be headed in with CW (as far as gameplay was concerned, story wise I could say the same about CW as WW2).",Zer0Sum12

Lootboxes are banned in the EU plus, WW2 had a quirky lootbox system. AW and Ghosts do not compare to BO1

Look, I'm not picky but a game with just the best of all 3 companies would be great. But what could possibly seal the deal is maybe having input from well-respected CoD community figures? Idk, but either CoD loses more of its soul or Activision stops outdoing EA is a greedy company",SkyllerzYT

We didn't have to deal with host migrations, hoping the game allowed us to play the maps we wanted, or playerbase splitting all the way through World at War, but then MW2 came out in 2009 and fucked all that up.

But those games are balanced differently, such as Siege, where there's a clear skill gap between PC and console and they just cannot be put together in any capacity.

COD is different, because console players get absolutely pampered to the point they dominate in lobbies against PC players of similar skills. Aim assist and all that stuff help to hard carry console players. Y'all are not at a disadvantage, no matter how much you'd like to think otherwise.",CornManJones

Also dude I dont feel like the modern day setting is an issue. People have had alot of issues with MW2 but MW 2019 was a blast.The issues being faced now are nothing to do with setting though it's just poor game design. MW is one of the OG series and it got ditched for a long time and we've only just got it back. We had black ops 2, Ghosts, AW, BO3 & 4, IW all that future shit for a long time before getting back to normal cod. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy AW and IW but for me that's not what cod is meant to be. Its meant to be like a war movie. Modern conflicts and if not ww2 or somewhere between. Leave the future shit to another company. Think part of the reason cods gone so downhill is from splitting their resources between so many company's making so many games in so many different settings. If they were to do something different I'd love to see a new COD called CALL OF DUTY or CALL OF DUTY 5. No more of this overly complex multiple, timelines, settings, subtitles just COD and make it good don't make another game for 5 years just one game cod. Add new campaigns as dlc sure.

\- weak ass killstreaks that are the same for few years already. I miss OP killstreaks like in cod ghosts or BO3.

Black ops 4 was the last cod that had a good flow for respawn modes - TDM and such. It didn't promote camping in one place, people were constantly moving u could feel the respawns and hear people properly. Now it is pure chaos.   
Also - we have shit to do in these games nowadays - nothing to grind for. I miss the COD MW remastered crate system where u could get every cosmetic in the game if u really wanted without spending money.  
Now they sell us the game which is shit, then they encourage us to buy battlepass, because if you dont, you will not get even one freakin operator skin, and on top of that every really cool item is only obtainable for CP. FUCK ACTIVISION",Medium-Hornet2470

30$ bundles for a few blueprints and a character skin which Little timmy will run to mum to tell her that he needs this, activison is just being ruthless with the micro transactions this year. Not to mention that they‚Äôre pumping out bundles left and right but ignoring the blatant core gameplay issues. 

Dead silence should be a perk no matter what. ‚ÄúItS ToO OvErPowEReD‚Äù then put it in the same category as ghost so you actually have to pick and choose which one suits the class more. Bo4 did the perks really well, putting Scav/flak jacket/tacmask in perk 1, gung-ho/dexterity/cold blooded in perk 2 and dead silence/ghost/tracker in perk 3. 

The lack of good mastery camos as well. Orion is so underwhelming holy fuck. And why is platinum even a camo. Why cant we just have each mastery camo look BETTER based on unlock difficulty compared to the prior. Why is gold the best camo in the game? What‚Äôs even the point of unlocking orion/poly if gold is way better? 

And the camping. I don‚Äôt know what it is about infinity ward but some head executives must have flipped a switch and gone from fun fast paced games to slow and boring window fights and camp fests. It‚Äôs been like this since 2019 with IW games but they refuse to acknowledge that the gameplay style they are forcing is camping. Putting dead silence as a field upgrade is COMPLIMENTING camping as you hear everyone stomping around like a herd of elephants falling down a flight of stairs at 2 in the morning. Literally the only way to kill them is to get grow a grenade but they will have trophy systems which completely negate the effect of them. I wish people would stop buying the new games so Activion could realise how badly they are making these games and that they need to do better

i admit SBMM has gotten more forgiving but it still needs to remain only in ranked. putting it in casual mp just kills the game for a majority of players and the people defending it need to get good. i got better by playing the sweats and learning their tactics and methods and then building off of that. not by only playing with my skill level. i feel bad for the people that are growing up with these games and not the older ones
