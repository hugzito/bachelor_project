They could learn from the experience and add extra restrictions.

Develop a better voting system if one exists, or maybe keep the other weapons in the contest that didn’t win under close consideration for future dlc.

I see the same comments here on this subreddit how people justify crytek's incompetence in saying that they've never faced a cheater, because chances are they 100% have and just don't want to admit it or they're oblivious to the fact that Hunt has a LOT of cheaters

It has no trade off and, regardless of game, when an optional trait/talent becomes ""mandatory"" for a mode, it is due to a dire need of balancing. There is no reason why a solo player wouldn't want a free life - there is no cost to them and there is no risk to the reward. You are already dead, so what is the worst that happens? You are dead again? 

Just a few ideas:

* Revive removes any kind of existing earned Hunt Dollars or Hunter Experience from the match
* The sound of the Grounded trait activating when a team released is added to solo reviving. 
* You can only revive ONE time and there is a 60-120 second time limit to do so. 
* You do a Tarzan yell when you revive so you can't be a silent rat about it.
* Resilience requires a team revive and does not work with solo Necromancer.
* You lose all remaining charges of tools you have equipped when reviving.",Chansh302

This is extremely disappointing and will change Hunt for the worse. I didn't want to play during the event because of all the solo cheese.  
  
Solo Necro is an unreadable game mechanic and the only counter is:  
  
  1) Knowing it exists and guessing (new players have no way to know and there are no in game signals that a player is solo or has necromancer)  
  
   2) Corpse camping or wasting consumables (which is boring and restrictive, or impossible if no consumables).  
  
It is game breaking in a team situation as well, but at least the teammate must get within 20m, and stand still in dark sight for 15s, which incurs a small risk, and it is partially readable. There is also direct counter play by killing the remaining enemies.  
  
As a solo there are no in game requirements, it is unreadable, it is quicker, there are 0 risks involved, and the counter play is very limited and boring.  
  
Furthermore, it greatly increases the ability to throw MMR. If a player wants to lose a lot of MMR they can just play solo necro and lose 5x the MMR as before. This is a direct opportunity for smurfing and noob stomping.  
  
It also incentivizes mindless aggression and kill trades, which contradicts Hunt's design of careful decision making and punishing mistakes.

It is bad game design that will likely lead to many players quitting. I am dismayed Crytek thinks this half-baked game-breaking mechanic should be added.",Chansh302

However, I agree with the general sentiment that it was a little too broken. I like the 10 second countdown but I would have taken it a little further. Keep the original 5 second countdown but then there should be a 5 second window for the solo to revive. Meaning they have to get up every 10 seconds. That way, as the person camping their body, you know they are properly dead if they don't get up in the next 10 seconds after downing them.

I mean u do not always have something to burn the solo, if you kill him in a forest, for example, then a teammate must watch the corpse and you need to split, that takes time, breaks the flow of the game and does not make much fun. 

There is a big fight and you kill multiple hunters, how should you keep track who was the solo?
If they are lucky they can revive like 4 times, how will you manage that while u are fighting another team.

You kill a solo, the team with the trophy is on the way to extract, every second counts, but u need do decide do you want to go after them and win the game and have fun or try to burn the solo who you maybe killed like 80 meters away, so that he does not shoot you in the back.
Also not fun.
  
The biggest thing is, if you kill someone in hunt you won that fight, it is just unfair that someone get a second chance, thats the whole fun thing about the gameplay, u place your shots good and you win, if you loose you just dont deserve a second chance!

Its just frustrating and i can not understand why you need to make this great game just less fun with that.

There is also the fact that the solo experience is just less intense, if you know the game good enough u just know how to play so that they cannot kill you bevore you revive. 
So its maybe more fun for an solo kain sniper who is just there to give you a oneshot while you are fighting other teams, but such a pain in the ass for all others.

I mean long timer accomplishes this but I think it still needs more limitations so it doesn't bring this many issues with it like mmr farming or solo cheesiness and need to be extremely cautious about solo bodies. I think it should either be possible to revive just once or the timer should double after each death or it should require a kill to charge or have a timer in which the player can revive or it could have a cooldown at least.

In fact it's not even finically viable to play solo 24/7 as you would have to have 1 successful game for every 3 just to break even on a mosin sniper loadout. Self revive gives me that chance to accept my defeat and at least extract with my hunter intact, or i can risk going in again but the difference being it's entirely on me this time if i lose my hunter and loadout as i was given that chance to get out.",Chansh302

I feel that maybe they should have given it a limit and I hope there is some sort of indicator like with the death cheat because as a solo KILLING a solo is going to be just as bad as a duo or trio killing them.

Everyone is giving this hate but I don't get to play with my friends as much as some people who dump 3000+ hrs into this game. I WANT to play the game more but either I play solo or I pick up some rando that might suck ass as a teammate. I trust my friends to watch my back, not some stranger. Did they buff solo's a bit too much with all this? I agree. But it sucks when I'm stuck playing by myself because I like the game but it can get really frustrating when you take out 3 or 4 people who all have teammates that can just kill you because they saw the shot then go rez their mate.

Again, if I could always play on a team I would but guess what......some of us have to work 40 hours a week and don't get to play with friends every game.",Chansh302

I'm mostly playing trio, and watching dead bodies is definitively a thing. Versus a duo or trio, I feel it's way more dangerous than the guy getting up by himself as you must watch out that his mates don't kill you before resurrecting him.

Also, when we kill some isolated Hunter, we're super cautious as we are looking for his mates. So I don't feel like having to watch a solo is terribly slower than watching an isolated Hunter.

The thing that I don't like is solo VS solo. There I think it's unfair, as you risk getting shot in the back while searching for fire or getting away.

I played only a few games as a solo, and winning any fight versus a duo is very hard. Getting a chance to get my Hunter back feels nice. Though I can imagine room for abuse that may need a patch of two. Four example, a loud and flashy animation would be a good start. Fixing the MMR stuff everyone talks about. Aggroing one or two random zombies in the vicinity when you revive would be a cool idea.",Chansh302

I’ll take the downvotes on this, I’m a pretty mid player and we never got wiped by a solo during the event (*at least not bc of the self revive*), in fact I think we kill farmed every solo we came across. I have roughly 2600 hrs in this game (*still not very good*) and I think this change is fine to keep things interesting, the only down side for me is waiting a solo out, but now they won’t keep their character and I’ll still get extra kills on them. 

If you’re team can’t kill a solo you have other issues, and I get that sometimes it would put a solo a star or two above you in the lobby, but that’s about the worst thing it can do. Maybe you all ran into way more solos than we did, but I feel like we only occasionally saw one.

Crytek obviously has the data and numbers to back up their choices, I’m sure peeps here crying “the death of Hunt” are the vocal minority that were getting farmed by solos.

But I think your titles needs some clarification for the people that did not see the video:

* 1v1s, customs lobbies -> There's no official 1v1 customs mode they talked about, nor normal bounty custom lobbies, they talked about a shooting range in which you can enter with friends and there you can enable PvP or not, so you could do duels and stuff.
* new map with biomes -> it's a new map with a new biome, not multiple ones. and it seems it will be a more desert like map from what we've seen. 
* training mode -> I guess you mean the new scripted tutorial with a voice actor?",ImSavageAF

Via Chatgpt;

> It was Christmas Eve, and Santa Claus was in trouble. He had been delivering presents to children all over the world, as he did every year, when he found himself caught in the middle of a dangerous hunt in the Louisiana swamps.
> 
> Santa had never encountered anything like the monsters that roamed these lands. They were terrifying, with glowing eyes and razor-sharp teeth, and they seemed to be everywhere. Santa had lost his sleigh and reindeer, and he was on foot, desperately trying to avoid the beasts that were hot on his trail.
> 
> But Santa was not alone. He had stumbled upon a group of hunters who were also trying to survive in this dangerous landscape. They were armed with guns and other weapons, and they seemed to know the territory well. They told Santa that they were trying to track down a powerful demon that had been terrorizing the area, and that they would help him if he could help them.
> 
> Santa was reluctant at first. He had never been in a fight before, and he didn't want to risk getting hurt. But he knew that he couldn't make it out of the swamps alone, and he also knew that he had to protect the children who were waiting for him back home.
> 
> And so he joined forces with the hunters, using his quick wit and magical powers to outsmart the monsters that pursued them. He even managed to use his bag of presents to distract the beasts and buy the hunters time to reload their weapons.
> 
> Finally, after many long hours of fighting and dodging monsters, Santa and the hunters found themselves face to face with the demon they had been searching for. It was a fierce creature, with glowing red eyes and long, sharp claws. But Santa was not afraid. He knew that he had to protect the children who were counting on him.
> 
> And so he summoned all his strength and courage, and with the help of the hunters, he battled the demon with all his might. It was a long and grueling fight, but in the end, Santa emerged victorious.
> 
> As the hunters cheered and Santa caught his breath, he realized that he had just experienced something truly extraordinary. He had never felt so alive, so powerful, so heroic. And he knew that this was something he would never forget.
> 
> From that day on, Santa made a vow to himself to continue to fight against the darkness whenever he could. And every year, when he delivered presents to children all over the world, he would remember the time he spent in the swamps of Louisiana, fighting monsters and saving lives.",ImSavageAF

How dare they!,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/11ni8hx/how_dare_they/,Inpaladin,"Nobody is saying self rez sucks because it incentivizes you to bring fire bombs, I don't like throwing around debate fallacies or whatever because it's usually incredibly obnoxious but I can't think of any other way to describe this other than a strawman.  Self rez sucks because it slows the pacing of the game to a crawl.  You kill someone, and then burn their body.  There is no teammates to contest the body, so there is no tension or potential for a fight.  All it does is force you to sit and wait 2-5 minutes doing literally nothing or risk getting shot in the back by someone who should be dead.  Sure, someone could \*technically\* go unnoticed as their teammate dies and sit to rat out a rez, but how many times has that actually happened to you?  It's extremely rare, where self rez is something you encounter like every other match.  Necro in teams has restrictions, extremely limiting restrictions.  Most importantly, there needs to actually be someone alive, but you also need to be within a pretty short range and sit out a fairly long revive animation to do it.  \*None\* of those restrictions exist on self revive.  

And before someone says it, I'm not saying that self revive makes solos overpowered.  I think solos are still at a disadvantage, even with self revive being in the game.  The problem isn't how well solos are balanced, it's that the mechanic being used to balance them is not fun.

How dare they!,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/11ni8hx/how_dare_they/,TripleScoops,"I agree in spirit, but I think this is missing the mark a bit, so I'll list out the major things:

Insta-kill traps: I agree, you can also just use vigilant or stalker beetles. The bigger problem, though, is you still have to deal with concertina, which is hard to clear, I'll get to that in a second.

Bounty runners: Stamina shots really don't work unless you're covering a huge distance, and even then, if they're running shots or conduit/magpie, it's irrelevant. The main thing with bounty running is that you often don't notice they've slipped away until they've already put cover between themselves and your team, at which point it's usually too late regardless of how fast you are. I think this is fine, just the main counter is to rush the lair, which has its own unique problems.

Concertina: Dynamite is not a solution unless you're willing to use every slot for it. Almost every 4-5 star lobby I've been in where the bounty team used concertina went nuts with it. You can simply replace blown up concertina with bombs and arrows too easily, and even if you do blow it up, the bounty team just knows what angle to hold. I honestly don't know why they made it so slashing and explosives are the only way to clear it, as it used to be way easier.

Lair rushing: See above. In order to cover all entrances, you need to go nuts with it. It works, it just isn't very fun.

Shotgun Camping: Way too compound dependent when it comes to Flash bombs and decoys. There are so many sprawling compounds where you can hold an angle and be reasonably safe from thrown dynamite and flashes, or the angles are too tight to make that a reasonable strategy in the first place (see Pitching Crematorium). You can beetle, but this requires a lot of coordination with a teammate, and is at best putting your teammate in a 1v2. 

Is it the worst thing in the world? No, if you get the bounty, you should have some advantage, it's just boring.",Zerzafetz

My suggestion for balance would be that the team that kills the player gets an audio cue sent to them if the Solo necro's that way you can just leave them to it and react if they revive rather than assume they are.",Zerzafetz

How dare they!,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/11ni8hx/how_dare_they/,shady_rixen,"I really don’t get the criticism of self revive. Most people who complain are in teams. Teams have 1 or 2 people who will cover their fuckups and revive them with minor consequences. Solos make a mistake and they’re dead and lose the hunter forever.


Much of the criticism for self revive seems to be “I don’t want to have to waste time to watch the corpse only to have him come and dome me later.” Which like, the solo is going to have less than 150 hp. The solo will be within one shot range of a lot of weapons. And you also have a teammate or two to, again, cover your fuckups. If a solo manages to teamwipe you with < 150 hp then you sincerely fucked up or got outplayed or made a mistake. 

Additionally, many players find it objectionable to just sit and camp and watch a solo corpse for 5 minutes. I agree, that’s annoying. So don’t do it! You don’t have to! Again if they come back and wipe you later, you probably got outplayed man! Honestly it seemed to me like during inferno that people almost ~wanted~ to fuck over necro users. Like give me a break. Solo players don’t have one or two others to cover their fuckups and mistakes. 

Also, so many people are ignoring the fact that many teams can and do hunker down and go full rat mode to try and headshot you if you loot their dead buddy. 

Trap the body, burn it, move on. You don’t have to teamwipe every single server. You don’t have to murder every single player you come across. You lose nothing out of letting a necro solo escape to extract.

I’d encourage people with major criticisms and hang ups to stop playing in teams and play solo for a day and just cross reference the experience. Also, many people could be forgetting that death cheat is not back. So while yes solos will be able to self revive, there will be far fewer reckless revive hunters because of the lack of death cheat, most likely.",Zerzafetz

Hunt is my favorite shooter but the one thing that I didn't like was how hit and miss a good gunfight was .. if I go down in a fight with my team and I spectate and see a solo rez themselves and destroy the team that clapped my team now that is some glorious comeuppance 😜 it is sad that people are going to stop playing Hunt because they are scared of the unknown solo that may have popped back up lol .. it just adds to the atmosphere of never knowing when or where the fight is going to hit and imo that is what Hunt is all about 🤟,Zerzafetz

All they buffs they made to solos make them feel like a viable option instead of a challenge run like they were before.

That being said because of all these buffs they should lose a lot of the lower mmr modifier, at least to the point of a two man team. They used to have to wipe teams all without dying with half the dark sight and then actually get closer to get the bounty. Now a solo can revive as much as any team (minus bounty revives), Have just as much dark sight, and use serpent twice as far away, as well as getting 600$ per bounty. 

Its at a point where they just are as big of an underdog as they were. With all these buffs solo players should have to play with people of their skill level. You dont have to play solo ever, in fact 2 friends trying to play together are the only time you have to have a smaller team.

2. I do bring fire actually, but to draw out teamers after downing someone, which is actually useful.

3. If you burn a solo they can still res, so you need to stand there waiting until it's burned out, and you still don't know if it's a necro if they do res, or a patient team letting them burn out.  It's just one more annoying thing to worry about, and slows down the game.  

4. Last, it's really not about the provisions allotment so much as the way it affects gameplay.  I already find playing with solos annoying enough as they're usually playing a very different game than teams.  Self necro just makes this worse.  Now I have some slippery, buzzy bee hanging around that doesn't even stay down after being thoroughly swatted while I'm trying to engage in actual fun gunfights.  

Let solos play with solos and teams play with teams (or at least give the option), and then solos can necro with each other all they want.  Have 10 self necros for all I care.

Only so much you can do when half the lobby is solo players. That is not an exaggeration either. During the last half of the event a large portion of our games if not most of them we played against mostly solo players. I assume some of the issues with that will change up just because no one will be keeping characters after death now. However unless I missed something (totally possible) it is still a 4 point trait. You can have a roster full of hunters just sitting around waiting on that +2 trait point award and go in to most of your games with self rez. 

Self rez is not the same as team rez in how it functions in the game. 2 things happen in party play with the revive mechanic.

1. Player A has to go to Player B's body and complete the revive process. During this they are often noticeable and vulnerable. 

2. Player A has to be close enough to use necro. This allows a chance that other players hear them when they go into dark sight. 

Currently neither of those are true. A self revive player just stands up and makes the revive noise somewhere in that processes (unless that is/was being changed). 

I play solos when my friends are not online. I used self rez during the event. I do not want that in the game. Never in almost 2k hours did I go into a game as a solo and think, damn I wish this was easier for me. I knew that I had certain disadvantages when I made that choice. That was part of the point was it not? At this point I do not know if there is a lot to be gained by arguing against it being in the game. Crytek has made that decision already. So cool it is here to stay. Then at minimum lets restrict it. Solo Hunters can now only join Duos. Let the Trios be the game mode be for team v team play. Or let everyone else that does not want to play with this mechanic have a check box for *do not queue with solos*.  Personally I would prefer the former. I have always wanted one of the modes to be team only anyway.",Zerzafetz

They still are gonna be able chill and wait. Which forces you to give up bounty if involves chasing a team because there a real risk hes gonna get up and shoot you in the back. NO ONE LIKES BEING FKING SANDWICHED! Espicially when its a player you killed. That is a angle of attack you used to be safe from being attacked from. I would know how abuseable this perk was because i was that guy who you burned listened till you ran after bounty. Got up and shoot you in the back. 5 minutes later. If you add salveskin now you burn even fking longer. Pretty funny how grounded got more value out of salveskin then infernal fk sake crytek. As an avid solo player we dont need lower mmr queue, higherbounty rewards on top of a fking self revive. I have been trapped umder 2 concertina bombs two tripwire and still survived with resilenece. 

If it was early in the game i just wait till the team camping my body was engaged by another team and shoot them in the back when they were pre occupied with another team. Yes they burnt me but i at most lost a small bar and was able to regenerate my medium bar. Being a one tap is nothing if they click on your head. This solo revive nonesense needs to be hard countered by burning ie you can't revive whilst on fire. If you give the solo revivie free reign they will multiple oppurtunites to revive espicially in chaotic multi team fights.This is too much!",Zerzafetz

Other Studios would have taken those efforts and would put them into a second Game (e.g. Working on ""New Gen"" Console, Engine Update, New Maps, New Features like roaming Bosses).

It really gives a good feeling for the game and it´s Future.

Not adressing everything at once is also a good sign that the devs don´t want them to burn out within a year. Also they could still follow the motto ""underpromise and overdeliver"".",Der_Spanier

It will explode after a certain time, wether you are holding or not.
* At all times you get an indicator that shows where the grenade will go. If it's white, you're safe from the explosion. If it's red, it means it will damage you as well.
* The indicator mentioned in the second point is dynamic. This means that the indicator has an end that will get shorter with time. You can use this to cook the grenade in a way that it explodes the moment it reaches its intended destination. To do this, you aim further than the intended destination, hold it there and start cooking, and wait for the end of the indicator to shorten until it hits the intended spot then release.",Magikuhrp

I was your typical FPS gamer with thousands of hours in all the usual dopamine shooters like CSGO and Siege.

Fast forward to 2022, I was now severely burnt out of all of these games and was once again scouring Steam for any other shooters to play. That's when I remembered about Hunt and gave it another go with an open mind, when the Serpent Moon event began. It is only then I fully started appreciating the beauty of Hunt. The gunplay I thought was slow started to feel methodical, the old guns I thought sucked started to feel satisfying asf as I started to love the distinct sounds and sheer power guns like the Nitro Express packed.

My friends love the idea of ex-fil shooters, but they're not sure they're going to like the gameplay, mechanics, learn the maps, and they don't want to dump money into it if they're not going to play it.  That makes sense to me, too.  Sure they could refund it, but that puts a pretty big amount of pressure to choose if they like a game in 2 hours that many of us have dumped hundreds or thousands of hours into and many of us still suck, myself included.

They need to simply rename Quickplay and just call it ""Soul Survivor"".  Then, make that part of the game FtP.  You can win a soul survivor game and have that hunter available to you in bounty hunt for free if and when you ""upgrade"" to the full version.  You can also accrue BB's and use them to unlock cosmetics as well.  Maybe offer a discount for the full purchase price by using some of your acquired BB's.  

Then, you've increased the pop of ""soul survivor"" games, exposed how awesome the game is to curious players, and given them even more incentive to purchase the game since they'll potentially have a ""head start"" at the game by having a bunch of free hunters to use right after their purchase.",JSaire31

Generally hitting an enemy with anything that causes bleed will be enough to kill them if they try and run away.

Gets washed away in water and goes downstream but continues on the other side of the streams when they cross, etc. if they don't stop bleeding. Have the blood trails last 15s - 30s on the ground depending on bleed level.

Have a perk make blood trail glow similar to clues but feint in comparison and seen through walls (similar to poison sense). Make the ""bloodless"" perk prevent bleeding from starting for 5s or something. 

I'd love to see more blood based perks as well... Maybe something similar to necro but for an ally to share their life with someone who is down a bar. Consumes one full bar from the user and ""donates"" it to them (at a distance) but blocks them from healing their own health back for 30s or something.",Jenn_FTW

I tried this yesterday with 4× small dynamites and I can say with honor that out of 6 games I've played, I killed no hunters, dealt 0 damage to hunters, dealt some small damage to unlucky grunt and once almost killed myself as I got aim-punched and missed the dynamite.

Yet, I've never had soo much fun seeing dynamites fly all over the place and blow behind the compound in the air

Until this becomes serious issue, I would keep this ""feature"" for now as it's fun, unreliable and requires luck and skill to do anything with it as you're most of the time just better of hitting people with real weapons instead

But as I expect reality to hit, this will be patched in the blink of an eye, while taking their time with the reload bug almost year or more.. for me, big L for Crytek if this is what's gonna happen, but other than not supporting the game anymore with my hard earned money, what can one man do :)",LUSTTEUFEL

Imagine lil ole solo me with just a knife and happen upon a spawn fight. Alas, I am safe for now ...So  let's hit the clue and compound/Towers for a chance at consumables and maybe a weapon.

Get to second compound, Ninja crows give up my position .. a trio now knows I am there. The push ensues. They have no Idea I'm solo .. they just want the fight. Luckily find a Slient nagant and  take one down with w/ Fanning. One of the other two throws a nade , Im bleeding and took damage and as I stop the bleeding and heal they are pushing .. I try to get to cover but they both have never miss dualies shooting at me and yes they hit every shot ... I am dead. Me this evil guy with just 2 eyes, 2 hands, by myself .. This Evil monster must be put down HOW DARE you try to take on 3 people by yourself or even a pair of hunters alone. You sir are the Evil of the swamp.

As I lay there, I can hear movement .. I can hear the traps ... I can here the metal clank of the lantern .. the wick lit of the Molotov cocktail .. boom I'm on fire .. I can stand up But I know I'm just gonna get put back down .. So, i'll just wait maybe they will leave and I will manage to get myself up at the last minute to survive. I'm now down to the last bar still hear running around me ..... man why are they still here? .. I mean they trapped me? .. JUST GO!!!! ... half way through the last bar ... I can hear them finally running off .. self-rez .. BOOOM perm death ... So Fun. back to the lobby.

So, much hate for the solos .. they willingly take on the high risk high reward when it comes to solo Versus - #'s. I don't care either way .. Self rez, no self rez .. will still play as solo.  With many things Crytek has done/Changed ... ""Cough"" Redskull revive ""Cough""  (IMO I think redskull rez took some of the fear/fun/risk out the game) so, people are never Happy ... But man if these post don't blow my mind how scared people are of a solo ... and the hate I read ... You guys are Burning solo bodies with hellfire, Forcing them to take razor wire bath's with posion soap bombs and bear traps ... and then Body camping ... all because of one wittle ole solo that has to kill all 3 of you... and possibly 4 to 5 other teams ...

This may be controversial but what if necromancer trait was removed entirely. Instead you have a self revive tool/gadget usable by everyone. And you have the ability to use it on yourself, via syringe; or in a projectile variant so you can revive a teammate at a distance. There could be a weak and strong version of it as well.

In my opinion this would be fairly balanced as everyone has access to it, it has a limited number of uses, you need to be somewhat strategic with it, and it takes up a gear slot , while opening a trait slot. Obviously you can still revive teammates in a traditional way as well.",TheOneWhoMurlocs

But since their ip and ids of their hard and software ids are not banned they can just get a new key for cheap with a new steam account.

TLDR; looks like it's gonna be a very good update.

Left peek advantage removal is fantastic.

Love to see the cent shorty. The uppercut might be a bit underpowered once it's out though, since the cent shorty should be statistically similar.

New tutorial is great and also unexpected. I just hope they're not nerfing the blood bonds from it in the process.

Equipment change is huge. Finally less clutter.

Combat log is nice to see but the UI needs work.

More weapon stats is super nice and also unexpected, but it seems they still aren't showing how damage dropoff works, which is very bad.

Solo necromancer should be nerfed a bit more, preferably less revives.

More loot is great, bounty hunt feels too light on scavenging at the moment.

The only thing I dislike is the Serpent buff, I'm not sure why they would encourage a playstyle where people not only don't fight one another but likely aren't even going to encounter one another.

Are we getting rideable horses?,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/11ka9di/are_we_getting_rideable_horses/,LazyBird_,"Technically, it doesn't fit at all with the ""rigidity"" of the game. The spatial interactions are very barebones in H:S because it's not the focus, I really can't imagine mounting a horse and then riding it on rocky terrain, when vaulting is the most advanced interaction with the terrain thus far, and it feels like a PS2 animation. Have you seen how AI, like hellhounds, move ?  
Horse riding, especially in first person, is a big undertaking, with a lot of animations and physics, implemented with that engine it would be horrendously clunky.

But most importantly, it wouldn't fit the gameplay and level design at all, it would make absolutely no sense. Plus considering the size of the map it would be very useless, even when running away with the bounty since horses would be very easy target. And it would be a nightmare to balance horses availability, health and noise without making it completely irrelevant or game breaking.  

Finally hunt has a healthy player base but not high enough that it can't quickly spiral into a half dead game if the number start dropping. If the team was going to add the most game changing feature, by far, since launch it wouldn't be some weird feature that almost no one asked for and that will most likely displease at least half the players.  

If this is suppose to be a teaser for something, it's much more likely to be the theme of the new boss or the next map.",zherper

-New Tool: Lasso. Use the lasso by charging with right click and throwing with left. Can be used to disarm hunters while they hold F to break free, can be used to drag monsters where you want them (except meatheads) and can be used to drag horses around! 

-New world item: Saddle. Find a saddle in barns and boss lairs to use on a horse. Carry it to a horse and hold F to equip! While holding it, left click to push and right+left click to toss it a few feet. 

-New mechanic: Horse Healing. Use a medkit charge to heal a wounded, screaming horse! Once healed the horse will calm down and attempt to stand up. If it fails you’ll have to heal it again! Once fully healed the horse will stand up and move a few feet from the location to graze! Use a lasso to move a horse closer to a saddle, or find a saddle and bring it to the horse! 

Now your stamina shot and Greyhound are useless since you have a horse!

If you saddle up next to another saddled player, both players gain an additional health chunk at the far left that is worth 10 Health points.

In about 50 hours of gameplay, there's only one time I got doubt. I checked the guy profile, and he had a VAC ban. 

I'm not sure what's the cheater rate nowadays, but it's certainly lower than when I used to play CoD MW2 (the ten years old one) which was more like 1 every 10 matches.

In official matches (well, clan calendar), we'd use a software which screenshot our screens from time to time, and any player could review them at the end of the matches. At the time, it pretty much blocked all cheating. We even caught one in our own team... during training. The guy got permanently banned from our team :-/ (and any clan calendar team).

For anyone new, they have no other means to earn BBs except from matches and occasional from library. Even the BB we earn from matches have been significantly diminished.

I feel as they remove BB requirement from respec and other stuff to Hunt dollars, BBs will truly become a premium currency that you can only buy just like fortnite v-bucks. Hunt dollars will become the cash that you can spend for everything else, making it more valuable. 

Every other skin costs 900BBs now and Hunters cost 1000. Removing any amount of free BB you can earn so people are forced to buy them is top notch greed and milking the game.. well blessings of the new monetization manager i suppose.",_yavi

i have one steam account and play all games fairly without hacks and this is one of my greatest fears. so i resonate with you on this, i’ve been banned before in call of duty mw19 twice. first time was “offensive” username and the second time was a shadow ban for being too good and getting too many reports, both were two weeks long and what i did was i tried to get in contact with someone to speak about this through multiple emails until i got it resolved. i’ve realized this with many other cases of mine that’s it’s about just getting the right person to listen. so i’d advise you to make a video report and send it to people who are partnered with crytek and try reaching out to crytek themselves so someone higher up can assist you.

the only exception were very rare ban waves of multiple people for program X (e.g programs like faceit/esea) that were resolved within 24 hours.

The thing that frustrates them is not being given a clear ""this file/exploit was detected thus we are upholding your ban."" They just say we detected something we determine to be a cheat so there you go. 

I know EAC can't divulge the information because then cheaters / hackers build workarounds, but it would be nice to know what it was. The guy I'm talking about streamed hunt and I have to say his audio was always very sketchy, like there was very little to no ambience noise except for gunfire and footsteps. I'm not sure, it might have been the way their stream is setup or their hardware but I always found it weird. And when I mentioned it they said their settings were normal :/. Who knows maybe messing with your system audio is considered cheating? 

TL:DR EAC will most likely uphold the ban, at which point crytek will wash their hands of it. And only you will know for sure if you had any exploits / cheats / anything screwy going on. I hope if you're telling the truth that they overturn the ban. And it's not down to server switching because I play on US East a fair bit too and haven't been banned yet.

Imagine that you go to bed tonight and tomorrow you wake up in prison. The warden tells you you're in for life. You of course ask for what crime as you committed none and they tell you that it's a secret as telling you would enable criminals to better hide their filthy ways. You ask if there is a way to get out and there is. You have one single chance to appeal your incarceration but you must prepare your own defense for your crimes. The ones you did not commit, the ones nobody is telling you anything about. Also the time of this trial can be anytime and you won't be able to speak there. You submit your defense, they review it and you need to accept their judgement. That's the end of it.
Talking to others in the prison you see that many are real crooks but there are innocents like you too. One of them tells you there is another way out. Money. You can buy your freedom. Sure your house, your car, your belongings are gone. You have to start from zero but you'll be free. Till the next time the system comes for you.

I actually decided to downloade the clip and run it through my video editor to check it frame-by-frame and then compare the results to the damage dropoff chart. Here's what I got...

The first shot unfortunately hit the left shoulder. :(Your shot is perfectly lined up for a HS but as she pivots to the right her shoulder tanks the round by mere *centimeters*. It is therefore considered an arm shot, unfortunately. I gauged the distance using the interactive Hunt: Showdown map and its ruler to be between 50 and 60 meters. Using the damage dropoff chart I can determine the damage of your first shot to be between 73 and 66 damage.

The second shot hits her right elbow, which also is an armshot and therefore the second shot does about the same damage for a total max amout of damage of 146, out of 150 required to kill.When trying to pinpoint the exakt distance to more accurately determine the exact damage of I found the exact distance to be 58 meters. Based on that both of your shots does about 68 or 69 damage per shot for a total of 136 or 138 damage respectively. Which also explains how she survived the drop, which I assume she did, for additional saltiness.

I'm sorry. It should've been a nice HS and you deserved the kill, but you were defeated by the arch nemesis of any gamer: Frames and math :(

**Edit: I did some calculations regarding fall damage and I didn't really come out any wiser.** It *seems* like the game calcs fall damage based on the vertical distance and air time of your fall + other bullshit like what you lands on (water and hay lowers fall damage) and appearently horizontal distance too because sprint jumping sometimes yields more damage than just regular jumps.

Anyway, that jump *should've* done 15 damage, but as I'm testing I'm getting different results. The same jump sometimes yields zero fall damage, the second time I take 10 damage but most consistenly I take 15 fall damage - which in this case where you did 136/138 damage should've killed her.

Unless she ran with a regeneration shot of course, which would heal up a couple of points of health during the two shots and her air time to the ground... Of course she might've not taken any fall damage at all because evidently that's possible too. But as she JUMPED from further up the platform she SHOULD have died from fall damage.Source: I'm currently jumping off the very same platform repeatedly with various results depending on where I jump from and if I just walk off the damn thing. **All in all all fucking bets are off regarding fall damage, idfk what's going on.**

You go into a solo round with the full knowledge that if you die, there is no backup and I feel self revives just take that away.

I just recently [uploaded this bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/1184c7y/i_have_never_seen_this_before_i_cannot_reload_my/) (r/Deathcounter0 pointed me to here). 

If I understood you well, in your video you say what triggers it is using the last charge of a tool or consumable and then firing/reloading after. But in my example this is what happened: 

I threw a choke(for the life of me I cannot remember was it the last one), on a narrow passage (Nichols Prison, the 2nd floor, the outside platform), some time passed. The duo I am fighting starts to push, one of them goes through the choke, I kill that hunter, I reload my bow. The 2nd teammate, fights me, I miss one shot, reload. Some time passes(I would say less than a min), we clash again, this time I don't miss, the hunter is killed by the 3d shot since I threw the choke. And then you get the video. So it is after nocking that third arrow that I couldn't re-load. 

My Hunt memory is not that reliable, but I am fairly sure that the choke is the last thing I threw before I killed the 1st hunter (and possibly the only thing I threw in that fight). For the life of me, I can't remember did I had any other consumable(assuming that matters) except one Weak regeneration shot, who's effect has passed by the time I killed the first hunter.",KermitmentIssues

5 stars you can just train it till you're good and you'd reach it in your Hunt playtime.

6 stars is you picking either shotgun or sniper and then play it like you're a goddamn camping specialist until you reach it.

How I know this one might ask, well let me tell you a story of a Romero run till prestige with 20k to spare and not wanting to waste that.

I bought Nitro every game I join until I suddenly don't have to anymore and suddenly I'm on a Nitro run and initially wanting to waste 20k now I got 25k and a 6 star mmr.

Since January of 2023 the 4 largest ESP sellers for Hunt Showdown have began to offer “ban free subscriptions” to their ESP cheats. Whether or not they are truly ‘ban free’ is irrelevant, the fact is that the discord’s which house these cheating forums have grown, with the largest being a little over 12k with 2-3k active users at any given time. 

I was originally not going to make this post until I remembered that [last year I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/x6ml8t/i_was_watching_a_guy_on_twitch_with_2_viewers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about a person who streaming their cheats, I was contacted by Crytek and spoke to 2 different people, both of which assured me he would be banned from the game, however he was never banned, and to this day is still playing Hunt Showdown.

What are your opinions on the not-so-obvious cheaters in Hunt?

Edit; will also just hijack my own comment to say that the screenshots in the image above are from 10 different cheat sellers who are deemed “reputable” and have between 4.5 and 5 star ratings. All of them claim to offer “no ban” services  and many of the reviews attest to that fact, there are consistent user reviews and discussions **going all the back to 2019**. Which makes me think that similar to Crysis 3, Crytek are just ignoring the problem",UsecMyNuts

Ran into 3 blatant cheaters last night while I was introducing a noob to the game. That really killed the vibe for him.

I've noticed that most of them just claim to be using reshade and crosshairs to get their advantage but a crosshair wont help you shoot me through 2 solid walls while I'm not making any sound.

I think we need to start hardware banning people when they use cheats and a slightly more aggressive anticheat would be nice. I used to be in the camp that said cheaters weren't a big deal in this game and that was true a few years ago but the game has been steadily growing and cheaters have gotten more brazen as they know the likelihood that they will get banned (and that the ban will be any more than a minor inconvenience) is very slight. For example I ran into the well known cheater ""Holigrams"" on his new account ""Hol¡"" (because his old account got game banned for cheating) last night and of course he didn't miss a single headshot and already was back over 4KD with a few thousand kills.

This is a serious issue that Crytek needs to address immediately if the game is going to become healthy again.

To the cheaters that are certainly reading this, I want you to know that everyone recognizes what you are doing and besides wasting my time, the only thing you have succeeded in doing is proving beyond a shadow of a doubt to everyone you come across that you are an entirely pathetic individual. I realize that currently reshade and crosshairs are for some reason allowed, I still do not use them because I have some shred of dignity and a true competitive nature. To me, using these things is a handicap and you are admitting that you do not have what it takes to play at the highest level without external assistance. I maintain my 5-6 stars without any external software. I play the game raw and I am better than you could ever hope to be for it. Take away your software and you little bitches drop like flies in a firefight.

E: Just to tack on one more thing. The big cheaters are usually the same people, they form clans and run together and they usually switch between the big 3 or 4 cheater clans. They advertise how many alt accounts they have if you get banned on your main for cheating. We all know who they are, its so ridiculous that more permanent measures haven't been taken against these people yet.",UsecMyNuts

B) Cheaters who use brain cells. They use cheats not necessarily to kill and farm without getting sweaty but rather gather intel through mechanics like wallhack and aimbot and use this info and numbers to predict target's movements. Then shoot and kill them without any suspicion.

**But to the point something that can be done?**  
Its solely up to EAC and Crytek  
But first of all, Crytek doesnt allow sharing of profiles afaik, they like have a problem if you share post summary screen and dont have names hidden? correct me if im wrong  
So we cannot help it pretty much because of this, but i get **this could be ""abused"" in terms of rule no.6 on reddit, but if somebody is doing that blatantly and we share it, it shouldnt be a problem imo**

Then next thing is EAC  
A bit biased opinion, despite i respect programming skills because it takes talent and effort**i must say EAC is dogshit anticheat, why? Past month(well it didnt happen first time) numerous false bans, people got unbanned so its not like am saying shit, reasons are uknown however because they dont tell you but ppl suspect keyboard/mouse etc. softwares (not macros, but like RGB stuff) are getting flagged falsely**  
Then people coding hacks/cheats, for obvious reasons are skilled in coding  
So its ""kinda easy"" for them to break down EAC to source code and within few days they are ahead and undetectable till new EAC update, then the cycle repeats  
They just need to use different method of hiding the cheat, and EAC can do literally nothing

**TL;DR Cheating will be never ending problem in gaming due to cheat providers being step ahead of BattleEye, EAC and basically any other anticheat that is used in lot of games (But Activisions Richochet is even bigger dogshit:D)**

Crytek can try to take down those discords and stuff, but they are probably a dime a dozen... And I'm not sure if crytek has to spend money for each claim, or if it's just a DCMA or similar claim or what. 

I don't think EasyAntiCheat is a very good thing for hunt to have. If R6S is any indication, alternative options like Battleye also isn't... 

I don't see Crytek really switching to Unreal 4 for Hunt, and I also can't see Crytek really making Hunt 2 anytime soon... 

If they won't upgrade their anticheat somehow, then all they really can do is hope EAC flags the basic/cheap/free cheats, and *maybe* review video evidence of purported cheaters... From my perspective, that's all they really can do.

This game has been just about the only game I've played for years, and has been my main hobby. If I suspect someone of cheating, I'll keep the video, trim it, and gather other details like their steam profile etc - so I can check on it later on after sending off the report. I had video evidence that I felt was very damning, and I want to say it took them 9 months after I submitted it for him to be permanently banned. Not even sure the video was looked at. 

Now, I also don't understand the tendency to give out temp bans. I don't cheat, so I only ""know"" what people have said, but I have heard for at least exploits, you'll get 2 week bans or something. And you can get a lot of them before being potentially permanently banned. Not sure if suspected cheaters are also given 2 week bans, but if so, that's just too lenient. If they're cheating, just perma-ban... Otherwise, it seems like you just want their money from microtransactions, can't actually prove they were cheating, and don't really care about the players that may play less or even quit because of these losers",UsecMyNuts

I've been too absorbed in Dwarf Fortress to try this personally, but I'm looking at this from a game mechanics perspective.

Obviously throwables have mass, and different mass at that. We know that you can shoot chokes and move them. However, because the bullets have very little mass, this doesn't move them much. However, we can deduce that a bolt, or arrow has much more mass, which means a greater amount of energy is stored when it is launched, and more energy is used to transfered to the throwables.

I haven't don't any testing, but I would say based on this hypothesis of how this actually works using the game mechanics, the medium bundle is the best overall for distance and damage, the small dynamite will go furthest, and big bundle shortest. I also believe the angle of impact plays a role in the bounce and distance, where obviously the energy is split between the two.

This is a fantastic interaction.

I'm advocating for this remaining as it's a natural physics interaction, and should be left as such). If they patch this interaction out then I expect the goofy jump and change direction like Mario in the air to be fixed as well.",Orbish013

Hunt showdown is a service you paid to use, and they cannot exclude you from it without a concise reason.

Physician? Good, but I only use physician when I'm out of vitality shots. I ALWAYS use bloodless when I'm bleeding. 

Also, if you wanna NOT bandage up and take the fight, bloodless makes sure you have tons of time since bleeding damage is really slow. Walked through a bear trap and about to get peeked? Not a chance.

Somewhere between a throwing axe and a sticky bomb.

Tattoos in general have a high threshold to not be cringe, especially when the person getting them has zero artistic awareness. They just get a mix match of varying tattoos on their body that have no connection other than it may show the person's interest, which in itself is silly to project your interests in such a superficial manner that you require it to be on your body.

But i disagree with Hornskin, straight dmg reductions shouldn't exist in this game. It feels so terrible not getting a headshot kill with hard hit knuckle dusters just because the enemy hunter came with Hornskin. (Same for Bulwark which is borderline op in some situations.)

Iron Devastoter is fine. Reducing reload time on shotguns. Pls not! Shotguns are fine as they are right now.

&#x200B;

Mithridatist is fine as is, the problem is that people who care about getting poisoned will take an antidote shot instead all the time(like myself.) The Problem here is not the trait itself, it's that the antidote exists.

Magpie change works, i might have another Idea, give all shots for 1-2 minutes per taken clue or bounty so it isn't a bad version of conduit anymore. All 3 Shots for picking up bounty, i still wouldn't take it. But i know some players might. For me the most important part is getting buffs when i push the bounty, not after i killed them.

(>!Keep in mind that these days price is less important that the place these traits are taking. Low cost? Fine but have too many and no place for good ones, only 15 traits to pick!<):

* **Adrenaline** \- I would rework this trait so it can actually be considered, and that would be all stamina restored, sprinting to max and melee to either full or the 50% you mentioned. (>!and yes, fast regen would be replaced by this!<)
* **Assailant** \- Currently it's 2 points (?), so I would just keep it as it is and go for 1 point. More appealing as a choice, but still takes a valuable trait slot  that could be used for better game-changing traits
* **Bolt Seer** \- I think this trait has its place, it costs 1 point so I wouldn't change anything. Me, as a crossbow player, this trait is fine and your suggestion would be actually a nerf IMO, as I would hardly be taking usage of that dark sight bolt taking. (>!but interesting idea of more usage for dark sight.. maybe new trait with more option would be better? not sure!<)
* **Decoy Supply** \- I would keep it vanilla, and add just throwing axes and knives to be collected with special ammo boxes (>!1 axe without packmule, 2 with / 2 knives without packmule, 4 with? wanna scrap this idea but whatever, it could work I think..!<)
* **Hornskin** \- Is this trait 3 points? If yes, I would go back for 2. If no, then it's okay as it is, as an anti-PvE trait, great for new players imo
* **Iron Devastator** \- would keep it as it is (and your suggestion is meh imo, shifting away too much)
* **Magpie** \- It's not perfect, but I would just keep it. No good change in my head for this one so it's good as it is I guess..
* Mithridatist - Poison is pretty weak as it is, countered fully with anti dote shots, so imo keep it this way, it's not popular trait but that's good. It's there for those who wanna get into no business with poison without antidotes, so would just keep it as it is.

Hornskin even buffed this way is pretty useless, but it’s hard to buff effectively.

If you could drop items too it could set up some interesting defense scenarios for example. If you found dynamite in compound, you could pick it up and leave it in a spot for defense when banishing so that all of team could access, but then keep other items you had loaded in with. Kinda how you can move world lanterns around in a similar fashion for use.

On that note, I think being able to keep disarmed traps and place them in inventory should be a thing if you have an empty slot. You could get rewarded as loot for being stealthy if they were not yours, or get to use them again if you brought them, but ended up moving positions.

The game looks super vibrant and beautiful without it, and you can see hunters better, no black clothes blending in with muddy backgrounds. The game actually has some color, but they put a filter over it that makes it look like shit and no it does not add to the atmosphere. 

To anyone who missed out on disabling this filter: it felt like Hunt 2.0. YouTube videos don't do it justice due to heavy compression, the difference was *massive.*

...and they disabled the option to remove it ffs, literally making their game uglier! ***That filter should be disabled by default.*** 

REShade rose in popularity when they cockblocked us from a good looking game cause people could not go back to ugly muddy grainy washed out old Hunt graphics. I know I couldn't. Who plays Hunt 2 graohics wise, then goes back to Hunt 1? REShade is what keeps me playing, and the game looking nice. It's not even about being able to see slightly better, in fact I see slightly worse sometimes, but at least it's not ugly, muddy, washed out and grainy. **Once you've seen the game without this default filter you cannot go back.**

I don't use a crosshair or any if that BS I just want a good looking game.

PS: this default filter is actually the sole reason why Cain had to be nerfed and why so many dark coated skins are impossible to see inside buildings if they don't move. When disabling the filter you could spot pre-nerf Cain no problem.

**I will never understand why they broke a broom handle and stuck the splintered end in this game's ass. If REShade is banned I'm out, no regrets.**

What makes it worse is that it was just a simple config file setting, they could patch it back in any time and allow us to disable the default filter again. And if anyone actually likes that filter, they can play with it on! But they won't because they don't seem to listen to the players when it comes to this stuff.

REShade can do much worse things and that's okay, but God forbid we disable that filter that makes our game look like shit.....",toshii_

Hunt has a certain color gradient to it, that is very limited and bland, and while it can look good to some people, others may want to make it a bit more vibrant. 

The only “real” solution, is to add in game color correction similar to what tarkov did. But this doesn’t stop anyone from using their built in monitor functions like crosshairs, gamma, zoom, etc. 

You argue that it has a built in zoom feature, but that doesn’t actually zoom, it just increases the image size of where you set it. So you will just see a pixel mess. It will never come close to being as useful as good aim or a scope. Not to mention, it would be a huge disadvantage to have to mess around with your settings based on your engagement, and I’m sure it would backfire and get you killed before you could even sort it out. 

At the end of the day, people are gonna complain and find whatever excuse they can for getting outplayed. I’m not saying that reshade can’t be used for an advantage, but majority of people complaining about it, are just salty about losing. It’s a hard pill to swallow.",toshii_

It does drastically reduce the one hit kill range, but the romero is already such a beast that I can get a one tap when it matters. It allows me to really put the fear of god in folks at range. The alamo already gives you a faster fire rate so getting a follow up shot on someone I don't kill in one hit at range isn't too bad either.   


Anyone it doesn't kill in one hit is going to be permanently debilitated. They'll be vulnerable to my long ammo teammates and are one step closer to being out of the game. If you destroy 80% of someone's health with buckshot they'll just run away, syringe, and then be back in the fight. If you destroy 80% of their health with dragon's breath they're gonna have to stop burning and they're just stuck at that low health for the rest of the game.",KenobiInNairobi

While it requires a two tap to ignite, it seems that as long as there is some burn damage still lingering on a hunter they’re likely to catch fire after being hit. The result is that teammates in a protracted fight can benefit from one another’s prior shots on an opponent.

Between the three of them, me and my buddy lit them on fire 12 times. It only takes one shot to light them up if you've already ignited them, so it only gets easier.

*One Google search later.*

So apparently there’s a few interesting quirks of goats that could be translated into perks. I’m going to list the goat facts first so we’re all on the same page:

1. Goats are sociable animals and become depressed if separated or isolated from their companions.

2. Goats are very picky eaters

3. Goats have a constant desire to “explore and investigate anything unfamiliar they come across”.

4. Goats will communicate by bleating, often calling their young to them so they can stay close-by; they also use a sneeze sound to alert others of danger.

5. Goats really dislike water; they’d rather leap over streams/puddle than walk in them

___
Nooooow for goat-flavored perk ideas (balance doesn’t really matter a ton to me right now; I’m just spitballing for flavor foremost):

1. (Social aspect) **Pack Hunger**:
While you’re at least [X meters] away from your teammate(s), your weapon steadiness, total stamina, movement speed, and health regeneration all decrease. While looking at *or being looked at by* a teammate in this state, these effects invert. **Solo only**:
The undead are considered your “teammates” for triggering these effects.

2. (Picky eaters) **Cabrachopa**:
Killing an enemy hunter heals you slightly.

3. (Exploration) **Curious**:
Any resupply crate you open will give double the usual supplies.

4. (Communication) **Goat Throat** (not to be confused with throat-goat):
Undead who hear you will become docile until they lose track of you.

5. (Hating water) This could be used as a negative effect to balance out a more powerful effect, like if we decided Curious was too op, we could say “Doubles supplies from crates; you take damage for every second you’re in water” or something negative that could balance out another effect (don’t take exactly what I said as like a perfect example; I’m just explaining the general logic behind how it could be a bane to justify a stronger boom)",snoman18x

Not because you can buy BBs with money that it equates money. Rewarding a player with fake game currency is a really far cry from giving the player money.

Also, most games who uses that type of monetization offers the player the chance to grind it by playing. Thats not new or unique to Hunt. Its actually really normal, unlike what the post suggests.

But I wanted more presents!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/11os2oz/but_i_wanted_more_presents/,alf666,"I'm not defending this business model, and I'm not making excuses for Crytek, I'm literally only explaining the reasoning behind it.

Does anyone here remember player-hosted UT/Quake 3/CS 1.6/CS:S/etc servers back in the early-mid 2000s? The players would pay good money to host their own servers in a data center, or they would buy a spare computer and run it off their home connection.

The best private servers for various games would often be found in clans, which sometimes had member fees or a ""donation box"" to allow their servers to keep running.

In addition, game updates were not very common due to the distribution costs, so post-launch support was infrequent at best.

In modern game production, devs and/or publishers have taken on all of these hosting costs in addition to providing consistent post-launch updates, resulting in the need for extra income past the initial sale.

This results in a rather strange adaptation of the MMORPG subscription model, where they sell you the game, and then they want to get a certain amount of money out of the player base each month on average.

You can see this best with Destiny 2, where the game itself is F2P, but each season pass costs money, and if you average out the cost of a season over its duration, it comes out to about $10-$15 per month, which is right in line with a sub to WoW or FF14.

Crytek has done the math, and they realize they spend X amount of dollars per month keeping Hunt's lights on, which means they need Y amount of dollars per player per month on average to meet their profit targets.

With Hunt in particular, the game has a rather niche game style being in the same general genre as Escape From Tarkov, and as a result has a very small player base to extract money from.

I remember [a past video the devs released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X6Q5Qqfw2w) where they said they looked at how many BBs they were giving away for free vs how many players were buying, and they found that players were only buying 10 BB for every 100 that were given away, and that this was resulting in the game not being able to sustain itself, so they reduced how generous they were to generate more revenue.

One way that has helped me wrap my head around the recent changes is to stop looking at Hunt as a ""Buy once, play forever"" game and start looking at Hunt as a ""Buy once, pay a monthly sub"" game.

Yes, it absolutely sucks, but it's what the reality of the situation is.

On one last note, nobody is forcing you to buy every DLC and legendary skin that comes out.

If you want to play the events and unlock the skins those give, feel free to do so, but please stop crying foul while at the same time opening your wallet every time a new BB legendary comes out.",jrow_official

I'm glad to see that some people understand the requirements for modern games to survive for such a long time are different and how some people are extremely shortsighted in their comments. I've always been impressed with Hunt and their approach with monetization outside of removing traits with BBs. 

I think some players forget that we have the trials, prestiges, and twitch drops for no extra cost to the base game. If you choose not to do those things (which is fine) then you aren't taking full advantage of the product you paid for. By adding additional content (legendaries of all types) you have the option to grind and save or outright purchase some content. Did you like the latest event? Do you like the direction that Hunt is going with 1.12? It's all due to sales and continued support.

Selling skins is by no means “predatory”, selling infinite consumables is. Even the biggest whale in hunt can only spend so much and will have something to show for every spend. They don’t even have loot boxes so no gambling element. 

And those comparing Crytek to Valve, Valve owns Steam so they can do all kinds of moves to subsidies an esport venture. Crytek can’t do that and Hunt isn’t even an esport so they can’t really do sponsored events either. 

Hunt is ultimately a live service. Hopefully when they sunset it they’ll release server software and open the game up to mods to keep it alive even after the fact(they won’t but one can dream) but as long as they’re working on it they have to monetise it, easy as that, and the way they’re doing it is fine.",jrow_official

Good design involves mechanics being intuitive within the logic of the setting. Put simply, movies and videogames for decades follow the rule that if you shoot an explosive, it explodes.

Hunt has a stale meta imo (especially in 5-6\*), but since every weapon can kill a hunter in one hit if used properly, skill can equalize the weapons shortcomings.

THEN, they made another patch utterly nerfing every gun. They were all hitmarker marchines. The MG42 went from a 4 to 5 shot to kill, to a 5 to 13. Some guns didn't have enough ammo in the mag to kill someone at 30m +. A difference of 2 meters could mean needing between 5 to 7 shot to kill, rendering ANY muscle memory obsolete and making gunfight completely inconsistant.

I don't know maybe add weekly storage on some weapons or something once you hit 100 lvl.,leapfork

This would breath meaning back into using currency as balance. Yes its more powerful, but you had to invest to be more powerful. Hunt is missing that part of the game play loop for looter shooters. Yes the pvp is fantastic, but it definitely isnt really a true looter shooter/tarkov alternative that people make it out to be, at least they failed at making it that way.",leapfork

Also FWIW the wiki has 4-5 years worth of patch notes and updates with developer commentary. You're guaranteed to find changes, and corrections to those changes, that riled up the player base.

That’s why you see people complaining about sometimes going up against trios with 1-2 6’s when they are 4-5 themselves, because they can be the lowest of 6’s and the 4-5’s could be very high 4 and 5’s.

That’s why you should always look at the Match MMR representation. First of all it is more granulated and shows half stars, and it also takes modifiers into account such as random/invite/solo.

If you enable SBMM in a well-populated region, you would probably only in extreme scenarios come up against someone with a match MMR that’s more than a star away from your own (the MM bracket width/size).",Lex_the_Grim

If you don't use them a lot, it's very easy to not have the built-in reflexes/mindset to use them properly. 

Around the start of the devil moon event, I started bringing 1 or 2 of them with me every single game to practice with, and by the end of the event, it was just automatic for me. When I'm thinking about throwing one, I automatically plan out where I want it to land and then make sure I'm playing near a corner or other obstacle that I can use to block the flash for myself. It sounds hard, but it's genuinely much much easier to do than one might assume. A lot of the times you flash it's because you want to safely push someone who is behind cover/around a corner, or to counter a push against you when you're behind cover yourself, so chances are there's something convenient you can use. The times you'll need to flash someone out in the open, and without something to block it for yourself is actually pretty rare. 

Also, here's a great tutorial on the specific mechanics of the flash bomb, and an introductory guide on how to place them properly so you stop flashing yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4vCpHkXPgU 

Flash bombs are the best throwable in the game, and I would say if you want to learn how to use them well, just start bringing them every single game. Think about how/when you're using them, and you'll start to build those ""don't flash myself"" reflexes after 10 or 15 uses.",Phineas2001

Don't underestimate the Hand Crossbow. Regular bolts are good at clearing grunts, yeah, but Poison bolts can silently one-shot both Armoreds and Immolators (without making the Immolator explode), kill crows before they can scream, and deal absolutely insane damage to any boss who isnt the Spider. Being able to instantly drop every moderately dangerous monster with near-absolute silence is super valuable, and has saved my life tons of times, between either keeping my squad's location a secret, or getting rid of a pesky monster that was about to fuck us over in the middle of a gunfight.   


It can even be used to cover downed enemies so they can't be necro'd (as the bolt leaves a lasting poison cloud) or make sure that solos stay down while you go and grab a lantern to burn them with.

It's usually best paired with a jack-of-all-trades gun like the Winfield, because that gun covers pretty much every situation besides sniping, so there isnt much reason to take a typical pistol, thus, the hand crossbow.",Drewbertttttt

1. Maps: the maps in hunt are meticulously crafted down to the last tree, box, barrel and haystack. There are always angles and routs to learn that you never thought about. There’s a reason why they take years to put together.

2. Guns: this may sound strange to a tarkov veteran, given that Hunt has only variants and no customization. But there is so much depth to hunt‘s gunplay. Every gun has a very distinctive sound, strengths and weaknesses. It’s paramount to learn these and play your own guns to their strengths and try to exploit the weaknesses of an enemies guns. A few examples: A sparks does a lot of damage but reloads slowly. It is best used at medium and above range and with sufficient cover to reload it. Playing with a sparks, I try to exhaust my enemies healing. Alternatively, once I downed an enemy once, they they are almost always a one-tap to the chest, because the sparks does so much damage. If playing against the sparks, move during its reload pauses and try to close the distance, where faster firing weapons get an advantage. Second example: I am approaching a compound, boss is banishing inside. The team inside shoots at me with pistols (uppercuts, paxes etc.). I can assume that their other gun is something close range, like shotguns or bomb lances (otherwise they wouldn’t have used their pistols at range). In that scenario, I would not want to try and rush inside, where I am likely at a disadvantage with my rifle. I should try to keep my distance, maybe bait them outside. Except if I also have a shotgun. Then I may be inclined to rush the lair and take them by surprise. And all of that is powered by sound

There is just so much depth to the gameplay of hunt. I myself am approaching 1.1k hours in the bayou and am still not tired. I may even be on the lower part of the playtime curve.",Drewbertttttt

Rinse and repeat with missions and looting (then wipe) vs an open sandbox style fps, but maybe it's just me. 
I've been playing Hunt for years and IMO, it's the most unique FPS ever with the greatest sound engine I've ever experienced.

Ive got about 3k hours in hunt and play with top players. I have much less around 1k in Tarkov. My recommendation is make good friends and focus on the PvP rather than the PvE of the bosses. It always feels good beating skilled players and outplaying them with strategy or better shooting.

It's the only thing bringing joy in this game, some weapons being the exception. I don't care about grunts holding lanterns or guns, I don't care about new bosses, and I don't care about the umpteenth legendary hunter.

Maps are what bring the spice to Hunt, and I cannot believe they're this slow on making another after DeSalle.

None of the things in the roadmap or new mechanics or map or boss. Nothing in last year and nothing in this year either ?

It is the only thing we r missing. Before I get dv, I know that wouldn't work due to the way the silenced weapons are balanced thrpugh damage drop off, but as a solo sniper, I can dream right? I think it could be balanced through a single shot, long reload, with low power that would require a headshot, but retaining damage over distance more than other silenced, but Im an idiot.",jrow_official

It's a vandal that's an issue, it's a silenced variant so bullet velocity and effective range is going be shit, It's medium ammo and to top it off it will have the worse ammo pool of all medium weapons. No one brings the centennial so why would someone bring this? 

Last point: its a 2 slot so either you are bringing quarter or actively limiting yourself to only 2 slots. Could shorty and specture compact or go duelies. You are probably not going be bringing a Mosin or a long ranged weapon with it. I feel like this weapon will be such a middle of the road weapon it'll be forgotten quickly.
